<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->
<p>
Google Analytics is such naughty software. I can't bear it anymore.
</p>

<p>Some of the things that annoy me are the data presentation interface,
which makes heavy use of java (I suppose and I don't much care).
That is extremely slow to load and process the data.</p>

<p>The interface is not very responsive when it is fully loaded, either.
It has got a lot of options but most of them don't make a whole lot of sense
to me.</p>

<p>It is clear <strong><abbr title="Google Analytics">GA</abbr></strong>
does not show
the raw data and try to make some specifics obscure. As my website has
got little traffic, I can see how badly GA tries to hide me the little
data there actually was collected from users!</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Comma Separated Value">CSV</abbr> spreadsheets are terrible,
<abbr title="In My Humble Opinion">IMHO</abbr>.</p>

<p>That is a sure thing GA first collects a whole lot of data
from my visitors and only after processing that it shows me
some of it in whatever representations GA thinks is better for
their  webmasters `<abbr title="users">useds</abbr>'.</p>

<p>Plus, its interface is very slow to load because it collects data
from we, webmasters, as well! There is no limit for whatever garbage
data they collect... If GA would only show me what GA sees...</p>

<p>Once I tried a service called <em>matomo</em>, but was wary soon
after reading its terms of use. And mind that the only statistics it showed
me was a <strong>hit counter</strong>...</p>

<p>If anyone knows of a <strong>clean, simpler and better service</strong>,
<a href="../../contact/">please let me know</a>.
Whatever a simple webmaster wants from simple statistics..</p>


<p>I will remove GA scripts from my webpage in the following days.
I am still deciding what method (<code>sed -i</code> or
<a title="Perl Pie : Replace String in Files" href="http://perlpie.com/"><code>perl -pie</code></a>)
and regular expression to use, or whether manually...</p>

<p>As for now, you can check webpage sources, press [CTRL+U]
in Firefox or Chrome.</p>
<p>Besides adding GA to the &lt;FOOTER&gt; section
of webpages (as opposed to Google recommendation to adding it to the
&lt;HEADER&gt; section), I know
<code>uBlock</code> can block GA scripts (at least partially)
from loading.. GA scripts should not be one of the first things to load
in the webpage or at all..</p>

<p>More two bad factors in using these analytics:
a) I don't know how many of these `<em>unique</em>' users are
not actually myself as I did not set filters to prevent that
and b) there were at least three days with
intense robot crawlings from various parts of the world.
So I reckon most of the data available to me may be
garbage at this point.</p>

<h2>Google Analytics Data</h2>

<p>So, before I just forget about GA, I am downlaoding some of their
CSV files. Available data is about the same as that shown to me
in GA web console.</p>

<p>In the next table, that is the full data about <em>Location</em>
of visitors since my website started using GA about 7 months ago,
which is what mostly I wanted to know after the total hit count.</p>

<p>This data appears to have robot attacks filtered out,
so I will assume these are reasonable numbers.</p>

<p>If reasonably correct with due reservations,
I am quite pleased with the reach of my website for this period.</p>


<p>But as Rob Willians from <a href="http://www.ratz.com/">Ratz</a> would say,
<q>who cares about page views [in a personal website]?</q>
</p>

<p>Besides GA not collecting data from me and my visitors, pages
should load faster.</p>

<p>I removed GA from HTML templates for the blog and podcast, 
recreated all blog pages and opted by purging the
other few HTML files (about 13) manually, so I would not
lose <em>vim undoes</em>..</p>

<p>Github history (objects) of this website repo will also be removed..</p>


<h2>Vaccine Frustration</h2>

<p>Mum got vaccinated when her age group was eligible on Monday.</p>
<p>Today, Wednesday, I tried to bring my aunt, who lives in a close city to my town,
to vaccination because her age group would have become eligible.</p>

<p>However, as I had last asked about vaccination on Monday and did not
confirm the schedule on Tuesday (yesterday), it was only too late
when we arrived at the vaccination center and discovered it had
been suspended the previous day..</p>

<p>Even though my aunt really does not live at town, she was born here
and always lived at the area. As mum could prove her home is located
at town, it all should be OK fr my aunt to have the vaccine, too..</p>

<p>I take the blame for not phoning up the vaccination centre yesterday
or even this morning before taking the highway trip.</p>


<p>Politics is terrible in my country. That is mad to turn on
the TV or the radio. Pandemics, vaccination and death are
the main topics. The president is against lock down and restrictive measures.
He confuses everybody!
Occasionally some weird news about the president attending
unimportant events..</p>

<p>For example, the president does not say <strong lang="pt">pessoas</strong> (persons, citizens)
cleanly
but also mouths <strong lang="pt">pens√µes</strong> (pensions)
when talking about the pandemics..</p>

<p>
I wonder what he is really at.
</p>


<p>Relative numbers about the pandemics and vaccination
mark Brazil in bad positions internationally.
I see the USA has got too many vaccines in comparison
to the rest of the world in absolute numbers.
That is not OK, either..</p>

<p>This is a somewhat stressful and frustrating day..
I am having some beer..</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>PS</strong>: even though I removed all GA scripts from my webpages
two days ago, today I was checking GA console and another bot attack was recorded
yesterday (9 Apr), which I reckon is not possible..
</p>
<p>
May that be Google injects <em>weyrd</em> numbers itself to confuse
and obfuscate real data?
It may be possible. I am glad about not using GA anymore..</p>
<p>But that is also possible this last bot attack at least
was performed on a
<a title="We are at the WayBack Machine!" href="https://web.archive.org/web/2020*/https://mountaineerbr.github.io/">copy of my old website</a>..
Cannot discard this possibility.</p>

<p><strong>PPS</strong>: Robots are really crazy, at least
I feel like <em>something</em> does like my blog..
Once some good YouTube bots left comments. After I mistreated their
comments (removed them), they gradually stopped commenting,
so I am reasonably sure those were <em>good</em> YouTube bots..</p>
