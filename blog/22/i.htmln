<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->
<p>
In the past few days I have been working on my website layout redesign
of the main navigation bar. Finally, I am satisfied with the results.
The <strong>blog</strong> proper uses a navigation bar from
W3.CSS framework so I will just leave that as it is for now.
</p>

<p>
I have been sending a lot of curriculums for many private companies
and i got no answer back, except one saying I was removed from their
selection but would still be in the data bank for another opportunity..
However, the e-mail was for a 3<sup>rd</sup>-party contractor which
omitted the company's name I applied for.. üòê

I am using my own shell solution to manage my blog and that is working
fine, although the code looks big at this point, but I am only doing small
modification for improvements as time goes by.
</p>

<p>
I got inspired by <a href="http://johnbokma.com/articles/tumblelog/">John Bokma's</a> <code>tumblelog</code>
scripts that generate an <b>RSS</b> <strong>and</strong> <b>JSON</b> feeds.
A <i>JSON feed</i> is over the top for me at this point, plus <i>RSS feeds</i> are well
adopted so I thought I would try and make my own <em>RSS generator script</em>.
There is plenty of code I was able to use from my <code>blog.sh</code>
shell script, plus I found this nice
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24984162/xmlstarlet-utf-8-nordic-characters">Stack Overflow thread</a>
and decided to go with <code>xmlstarlet</code>,
even though it is not too difficult to generate my
<a href="../../sitemap.xml">sitemap.xml</a> file with shell and <code>sed</code>.
</p>

<p>
I am now trying to understand some more about <i>XML</i> in general.

<h2>Some RSS Feeds</h2>

<p>I am studying some <i>RSS feeds</i> from some
high-quality people.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://stallman.org/rss/rss.xml">Stallman's</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml">Luke Smith's</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://archlinux.org/feeds/news/">Arch News Forum</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://johnbokma.com/index.rss">John Bokma's RDF feed</a>
	<br>
	(which is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_rdf.asp">another beast</a> completely)</li>
</ul>

<p>I shall clone Richard Stallman <i>RSS feed</i> template,
including namespaces define in the <i>XML</i> document, but I will try and
avoid using <code>&lt;![[CDATA]]&gt;</code> arrays for pasting <em>HTML</em> code under
the item's <q>description</q> tag as in Luke Smith <i>RSS feed</i>.
</p>

<p>Although here is the catch, I will not paste unescaped <i>HTML</i> code
and will follow Arch <i>RSS feed</i> scheme. Luckily,
<code>xmlstarlet</code> can do that escaping for us! 
Meaning that <i>HTML code</i> will be translated into <i>HTML entities</i>,
but that will generate parsing errors if I wrote <i>HTML entities</i>
in the raw blog post myself.. Need to think more about this..
Just use <code>&lt;![[CDATA]]&gt;</code> arrays as in Stallman's feed?
</p>


<p>I reckon our <i>RSS feed</i> should stay compatible with standards
this way but of course it will comply better over time as I adjust it..
</p>

<p>I am just not sure if only a brief <em>summary</em> of the blog article
or 
the whole blog article should de added
in the <i>RSS feed</i>. Luke Smith does that sloppily because
he cannot use all <i>HTML</i> elements, just simple ones such as
<code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> according
to <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/RssContent">this reference</a>,
so lets see what sort of HTML he injects in his new feed..
</p>

<p>Note: Luke has just changed his <em>RSS feed</em> and is using
<code>&lt;![[CDATA]]&gt;</code> now.. Indeed, he has been redesigning
<a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/">his whole website</a> recently.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="lukerss.png" alt="" width="505" height="267">
	<figcaption>
	Fig 1.
	Just like my own RSS feed, Luke's feed is also having
	some heavy design updates..
	</figcaption>

</figure>


<p>
The <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> tag <strong>is</strong> reserved
for the blog posting system, however the way that is planned to be used
is to <em>optionally</em> write a summary for each article 
in a <em>different language</em> other than the post itself
(so content can reach a more different visitors that way, even if partially).
</p>

<p>
That will not do for the <i>RSS feed</i> system, though..
If I cannot include
the full blog post content (with the exception of graphics),
then I will just <code>head</code> the post content and add that
to the <i>RSS feed</i> entry, 
<em>OR</em>, <code>grep</code> the <em>description metatag</em>
of each blog article, which I need always fill manually (for Search Engines)
anyway..
</p>

<p>Hopefully, there will soon be an
<strong>RSS feed</strong>
button in the blog homepage..
</p>

<hr>
<p>It seems that the right way to do this is to use
<code>xmlstarlet</code> and comply with its bidding.
The following quote made me realise this:
</p>

<blockquote>
	It comes down to this: XML is not a string. Don't treat it as one.
	Don't use or create tools that treat XML as a string.
	XML requires a parser - and all conforming parsers will do the
	right thing in this situation.
	<br>
	--<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33236078/why-xmlstarlet-replaces-to-gt-in-a-string">Tomalak</a>
</blockquote>

<p>In reality we should not be adding much more than a simple
description in the <i>RSS</i> <code>description</code> tag, you can
escape some <i>HTML</i> code but
<code>xmlstarlet</code> will throw some errors because of <i>strings</i>
such as <q>=&amp;gt</q> in <i>URLs</i>, which really should be encoded
in the first place but we are not so perfect..
</p>

<p>Stallman bypasses that using <code>&lt;![[CDATA]]&gt;</code> array and adding
unescaped <i>HTML code</i>, such as <em>URLs</em>, etc to it.
Arch New feed translates <i>HTML code tags</i> to <i>HTML entities</i>,
which should be treated as proper <i>HTML code</i>
by the <i>RSS parser</i> when reading the <code>&lt;![[CDATA]]&gt;</code> field (hopefully)..
</p>

<p>Either we can go simple and use <code>xmlstarlet</code> help
or we can go nuclear the Stallman's way and use <code>sed</code>
to generate our <i>RSS</i> document.
</p>

<p>There does not seem to be a single way of encoding data
in description in <i>RSS 2.0</i> as explained
in the last references above.</p>


<hr>
<p>For simple descriptions with few and simple <i>HTML</i> tagging,
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5272819/xmlstarlet-parser-error-entity-not-defined">TrinitronX's answer</a> 
at Stack Overflow suggests using <code>tidy</code> 
and transform named entities to numeric entities plus
converting <i>HTML</i> to <i>XHTML</i>, which seems to work
to inject almost any <i>HTML</i> data in the <code>&lt;description&gt;</code>
element.. However, that will fail if you have escaped <i>HTML entities</i>
in you <i>HTML</i> codes. Also,
<code>xmlstarlet</code> does not care about <code>&lt;![[CDATA]]&gt;</code>
tags and will escape/convert all <i>HTML</i> code to entities..
</p>

<p>I was considering creating <strong>two channels</strong> in a single
<i>RSS feed</i>, one with just a description of each post and another
one with the full content of posts, which is generally more useful.
</p>

<p>Instead of using <em>two channels</em>, there is an alternative
using Atom namespaces but I don't see any major benefit plus
I need studying Atom more..</p>

<blockquote>
	In case of Atom, you could even provide both in the same feed:
	a content element for the full content, and a summary element
	for the excerpt. (I guess other feed formats allows this, too.)

</blockquote>

<p>I installed <a href="https://newsboat.org/"><code>newsboat</code></a>,
available from the official repos.
<a href="../../repo/dotfiles/.newsboat/config">After configuring it</a>,
that seems a really cool cli news aggregator, I recommend it!
I am also testing <a href="https://quiterss.org/"><code>QuiteRSS</code></a>
(GUI, on reconsideration, it is a very impressive reader),
Thunderbird add-on
<a href="http://gnome.eu.org/index.php/Evolution_RSS_Reader_Plugin"><code>evolution-rss</code></a> (very good!),
Firefox add-on
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/livemarks/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search">Livemarks</a> (rather simple),
and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.madsvyat.simplerssreader&hl=en&gl=US">RSS Reader</a> (for Android).
They all behave in different ways..
</p>

<p>
I added
<code>&lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Biology Blog RSS" href="rss.xml"&gt;</code>
to the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> of <i>index.html</i> to reference the <i>RSS Feed</i>.
</p>

<p>After a lot of trying, I decided to go the Stallman way
and release two feeds, the
<a href="../rss.xml"><span class="arialbfont" style="font-style:italic; font-variant: small-caps; color:crimson; background:orange;padding:.2em;">Default RSS Feed</span></a>
which shall contain only short descriptions of posts
and the
<a href="../rss_alt.xml"><span class="arialbfont" style="font-style:italic; font-variant: small-caps; color:crimson; background:orange;padding:.2em;">Alternative RSS Feed</span></a>
which shall contain full content of posts injected within
<code>&lt;![[CDATA]]&gt;</code> arrays (and is bigger in size).
</p>

<hr>
<p>Testing my feeds with <code>newsboat</code> and
there seems that some bad or complex HTML code in my
posts may make <code>newsboat</code> parser go nuts at times.
</p>

<p>As <i>RSS</i> really stands for <em>Really Simple Syndication</em>,
and that is so easy to open the full content in a proper (cli) web browser with
<code>newsboat</code> and other <em>RSS feed readers</em>,
I have decided that the main feed will contain short descriptions
of blog post entries
and there will be an alternative feed for full content,
for those who want it. But I cannot guarantee your news reader
will process the alternative feed correctly..</p>

<p>
Even though delivering full content by defaults would seem the most useful
approach for the visitor, my posts do contain a lot of HTML code
and thus really  <strong>are not</strong> supposed to be parsed by
the <i>RSS feed reader</i>..
For example, if I wrote posts in <code>markdown</code>, that could
easily be converted to simple HTML, encoded appropriately 
and injected in the <i>RSS feed</i>.
When received, it would be parsed correctly by the RSS feed reader.</p>

<p>Another factor involved is size.
The short description feed is more than 10 times smaller
in size than the full-content feed (16.28KB vs 171.15KB).</p>

<p>If you are subscribed to the main RSS feed already,
hopefully there may be some problems on your side when I do the switch.
If so, <strong>please remove and re-add my feeds</strong>.</p>

<p>Specially now that I am also setting proper <em>guids</em>
<em>(global identifiers))</em> to my feeds. Eventually, I will need
<em>guids</em> unrelated to my website address to make sure items
are unique for podcast items and permanent whenever I move from website host
(currently github)!</p>

<p>The feed<strong>s</strong> should be stable in a matter of few days..
Sorry about any inconvenience while I get all that sorted out..</p>
