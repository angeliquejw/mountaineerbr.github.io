<!-- SUMMARY IN ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE -->
<div lang="pt" class="p-summary"><p>
Levei meu pai para tomar a primeira dose de vacina na minha cidade.
Tamb√©m pegamos uma bula da vacina, a Coronavac do Butantan.</p></div><br>


<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->
<p>
Finally, the age group of my father was eligible to take a vaccine shot
against Covid. Here in Brazil, most vaccines are from <a hreflang="pt" href="https://butantan.gov.br/instituto-butantan">Butantan Institute</a>.
This is a good vaccine, not so powerful as Pfizer's and others but
should be the safest of all. This vaccine is made with old and fully-tested
technology.

**their differences

<p>
?This vaccine uses a chimp adenovirus as the vector or envelope of
the Covid virus RNA chunks.

<p>Father was rather anxious about this shot. He doesn't really live
in the same town as I do but vaccines for his age group got here earlier
so we arranged for him to get his shot here.</p>

<p>That was a fun day. We were just a little worried he would be unable
to get the shot but all went well.</p>

<p>Father asked the nurse for a medicine leaflet of then Coronavac vaccine and
she gave it to him. I took a photo of it.
