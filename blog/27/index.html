<p>Notas rápidas dos primeiros dias de uma viagem a trabalho em que
deveria ser feita a colheita manual de várias plantações
experimentais..</p>

<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->

<p>I was set for a team of <em>external trip</em> about 300Km from
the company headquarters. We would manually harvest a big area with
many different soy technologies, as the company is focused on
genetically engineering strains and will need collect all sorts of
information from the soy beans to advance their research further. I
should not be very specific about anything because of contractual
terms, but will talk broadly because anyone minimally working in
this agricultural field will know about these and other routine
procedures..</p>

<p>I was happy to do some hard work as the <em>human resources</em>
woman had told me it would be.</p>

<p>I was <strong>not</strong> wrong when we started pulling the
plants and I said jokingly <q>that seemed to be the easiest
part</q>!</p>

<p>The hard part was carrying all those plants back to the truck
and handing them over to the truck boys, so a machinery would
process and have the material labeled.</p>

<p>As I was the eldest novice, they would give me a little more
hard work and, of course, I wanted to do all the hard working I
could so not to leave a bad image..</p>

<p>I had some terrible shortness of breathe, even thought about the
possibility of passing out but kept working hard, sometimes I would
just sit down on some straw material and catch my breath for a
couple of minutes. That worked but I had to do it constantly, and
resting 10 minutes was enough to feel comfortable even under the
sun.</p>

<p>I actually was working close to the machinery without the ear
protection (I had forgotten it back in the hotel!), so the noise
must have gotten into my brain.</p>

<p>But also, as I <em>was</em> using a tight mask to avoid
breathing dust and particles, coming from an extremely sedentary
period of my life and still a smoker (although I am working on
reducing and quitting it!), my body obviously would not handle 3 or
4 days of such a hard work.</p>

<p>I sincerely thought I was a little more physically fit than I
actually am right now..</p>

<p>At the end of day, we were together talking and having some fun
at the hotel and after everyone went to their quarters, I knocked
on my supervisor door and told him to end the experience.</p>

<p>In retrospective, I think I should have tried at least one more
day without telling my supervisor anything and taking any decision,
or should have warned him that I could only work so much instead of
asking for the end of the experience period. It was a rather
drastic decision and I was too nervous to think with due care and
diligence but, then, maybe my performance could become
<strong>shameful</strong> as time would wear on my strength..</p>

<p>I was devastated to leave them without my effort. I arranged to
work until lunch time the next day so they would still get some
(small) help from me. My supervisor took good care of me and drove
me all the way back (unfortunately, I could not simply take a bus
back with my own money, which I did insist on many times).. He told
and explained many precious things to me during the trip back, for
which I am so grateful.</p>

<p>So I am not sure what will happen next. In the worst case
scenario, the company will end the contract in the next few days.
In the best case, it will assign me a different kind of work which
I am able to perform until the contract expires in about 3
weeks.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong. I liked to work there. I observed everyone
and everything. Perhaps I haven't got an elephant memory but did
learn a lot. I find their work really amazing and have got the
greatest of respect for it. It will eventually generate soy which
is cheaper, more productive and efficient for the farmer, and also
more nutritious (more protein), cheaper and of higher quality for
the end consumer.</p>

<hr>

<p>After thinking about it over, such a common expression in this
field <a href=
"https://cropsciences.illinois.edu/research/crop-genetic-improvement/">
<em>genetics</em></a> and <a href=
"https://www.luke.fi/en/natural-resources/agriculture/plant-improvement/">
<em>plant improvement</em></a> is really just <em>genetics
improvement</em> because you can not teach a plant how to use less
water, for example. I reckon any distinction is not really
necessary <em>unless</em> to (maybe) consider <a href=
"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4655/4/4/25/htm">epigenetics
heritage</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> the company decided to end my experience
contract due to the fact my supervisor could not find another
department with a vacancy for me. <strong>Human resources</strong>
woman was nice and said something like <q>maybe it will work out
better next time/chance!</q>..</p>

<p><strong>PPS:</strong> Here is an <em>excellent</em> video sample
they sent to the harvest WhatsApp group on the second night.. After
this, the younger agronomists became more talkative about women,
dates, sex, massage houses and the sort.. <strong>Enjoy the best of
countryside girls!</strong></p>
