<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->

<p>
I have been making some charts with data from
Johns Hopkins University CSSE and
Reuters News Agency to check how the number of 
new cases, recovered and deaths are developing.
</p>

<p>
I update the charts almost everyday.
You can check them at
<a href="https://github.com/mountaineerbr/coronaPlot">my github repo of covid19 graphs</a>.
Unfortunately, I only discussed my opinion about them
in one unrelated forum, needed to get those references to
put them in my blog sometime.
</p>

<p>
I have been very curious about another type of graphs, that of positivity.
As the amount of test number per day have been variable since the pandemics
start, I thought it would be helpful if we could analyse the data
taking out such a parameter from the equation (in this case, graphs).
</p>

<p>
For one thing, we should not be keen to analyse the absolute numbers,
as there are so many diverging opinions, such as either numbers are
over or underestimated.. So they are not much good.
Let's check proportions!
By the way, that is a tip from
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/officialmcafee">John McAfee</a>,
who is currently in jail in Spain #freemcafee).

<h2>Experimental charts for Covid19 test <em>positivity</em></h2>

<p>
How many percentage points of test results are positive to Covid19?
I could not find positivity charts around with long time series,
so I decided to make some charts with Brazilian data.
Below is my try for charting data from Paraná State reports.
</p>

		Fig 1.
		Positivity graph from data of the state of Paraná.
		Y-axis for positivity percentage of total tests analysed,
		X-axis relative date.
		That is one state with the lowest positivity rate
		amongst all I could see with this analysis.
		Data ranges between 03/feb/2020 and 06/dec/2020.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
	<img src="20/results_pr_long.png" alt="wider graph, same as fig. 1" width="3200" height="800">
	<figcaption>
		Fig 2. 
		Same as fig. 1, but we see absolute dates in X-axis.
		I am <em>not</em> sure how to configure <code>gnuplot</code>
		to show fewer x-ticks and make them more readable, so
		that is why it is so wide..
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>
To see charts with data from all states, check
<a href="https://github.com/mountaineerbr/coronaPlot/tree/master/SUSOPENDATA_2020-12-24">my corona virus repo</a>.
</strong></p>

<p>
Analysing positivity rate is independent on test capacity,
meaning it does not matter if there is more testing now
than at the pandemics start. Everything can be levelled.
</p>

<p>
I got the data from <a href="https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/dataset/casos-nacionais">SUS OpenData</a>
That is not the cleanest data.
I extract values for Positive cases and Negative cases with some <code>awk</code>ing.
</p>

<p>
After download the csv files, you can check the header line which contains
the column keys:
</p>

<pre><code>% head -1 dados-pr.csv | tr \; \\n | nl

     2	dataNotificacao
     3	dataInicioSintomas

    26	validado
    27	idade
    28	dataEncerramento
    29	evolucaoCaso
    30	classificacaoFinal</code></pre>


<p>
The following shell function was used
to calculate positivity.
The shell will loop through all csv files given and
group results by date.
</p>

<p>
Some <code>awk</code> conditionals will test
values from columns $12 and $30, and will decide if that
will be counted as a positive case, a negative case or be ignored.
There is no guarantee this analysis is sufficient.
</p>

<p>You can check the script with some functions to process the data
at my <a href="../repo/scripts/corona_notifyBR.sh">sub repo</a>
for covid test positivity studies.
</p>

<p>
The last step is to generate graphs with <code>gnuplot</code>.
I am having some difficulty with the x-ticks dates because
<code>gnuplot</code> only accepts numbers by defaults..
May as it be, bear in mind the data  start from about February
and ends on 24<sup>th</sup> December.
</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>
Well, I have been avoiding interpreting Sars-2-Covid data too hastily,
as I am learning a lot in this pandemics from a scientific perspective
myself..
</p>

<p>
But the whole point of making these graphs was to try and see if
we could get a reading in which gross number of covid tests
applied would not be a variable in time analysis.</p>

<p>My experimentation is very rudimentary. I did not try to improve
the filtering of the OpenSUS data very much after the initial effort.
However,
it is well-known
from various news outlets that
the number of tests taken per day by patients has increased,
generally, but we also know it fluctuates over time,
i.e test production capacity has increased since the very beginning
of the pandemics, logistics has had occasional setbacks to deal with,
and also
it seem reasonable that less covid tests were applied when positive cases
generally decreased, and vice-versa..
</p>

<p>
With more diligent work onw can smooth out the variable number
of covid tests done per day from chart data and surprising results are
to be obtained.
All available points from historical data sets ought to be used
for the results of such an analysis be clear and meaningful
from a long term and wholistic perspective.
