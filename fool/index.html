<h2>Beware of conservationism</h2>
<p>
Think about dynamic structures and how their components
are never truly in equilibrium. Systems with more than
two variables are called complex systems.
I reckon that is much better for us to think about
<strong>integration</strong>
with our environment.
</p>

<p>
Equilibrium may seem attractive at first,
but further investigation will prove that after a rise,
equilibrium, climax or plateau may mean trend reversal
and decline.
Equilibrium is worse than a continuous rise, only better
than decline. Equilibrium is very monotonous and
more alike mineral matter.

<h2>Cautela com conservacionismo</h2>

<p>
Pense sobre estruturas dinâmicas e como seus componentes
nunca estão realmente em equilíbrio. Sistemas com mais de
duas variáveis são sistemas complexos.
Acredito ser melhor pensarmos em <strong>integração</strong>
com nosso meio ambiente. A expressão <i>equilíbrio</i> pode
soar atraente no primeiro momento porém não resiste ao
escrutínio maior. Equilíbrio, clímax ou platô podem ser
um sinal de reversão de tendência e próxima queda.
</p>

<p>
Aqui no Brasil, perdemos muito espaço no mercado de trabalho
para os engenheiros agrícolas, florestais, gestores de águas,
veterinários e biomédicos.
Não podemos continuar com o dogma da conservação a todo custo
sem entendermos que é necessário o <strong>gerenciamento</strong>
dos recursos para podermos continuar crescendo de forma saudável.
Acho que os biólogos deveriam entender melhor a respeito de
ciclos naturais para podermos promover a riqueza da população
humana, assim como acalmá-la, pois o <strong>medo</strong> enfraquece
o homem.

O grande problema ambiental brasileiro é
a falta de saneamento básico e a pobreza de
sua população.

	That is a little outrageous such misleading news built upon
	a private company (SkyCool) and a patented technology from 2014.
	<a title="A scientist who can cut your electricity bill" href="http://blogs.nature.com/indigenus/2017/10/a-scientist-who-can-cut-your-electricity-bill.html"><q>The material, made of seven layers of silicon dioxide and

	systems, reducing system spending of electricity.
	Is not so cheap: <q>[the tester] would only owe SkyCool Systems
	the savings from his electricity bill for the first two years</q>
	and
	<q>[it saved an experimental client] $3,000 over the course of the summer</q>,
	<a title="SBIR Phase I: Radiative Sky Cooling-Enhanced Refrigeration System" href="https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/1217007">but also requires addition of a coupled water pumping system.</a>
	Where are they going to extract those minerals to make the films from?
	I dare say the generation process of this nanotech film
	consumes a lot of electricity, too, so I wonder how long before
	implementation of this system will actually start saving electricity..
	There is something worse on top of it all, it seems there is
	much broken physics for merchandising.
	While system optimisations are welcome, the energy reflected
	from these <em>super mirrors</em> will be absorbed by atmosphere
	solid particles much before reaching stratosphere, so that is
	not going to help cool the planet, however they may think
	and be literal in
	<q>the world now cools off with the help of more than 3.5 billion
	refrigerators and air conditioners</q>.

	The systems depicted in the paper are highly unstable and have 
	a high coefficient of roughness, and as such could only be
	well represented stacking multiple snapshots of the system
	within a time range. Anyway, much of the photos and videos
	span Summer time periods in the Southern Hemisphere.
	<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/09/08/1912890117/tab-figures-data">The paper</a>

	Accumulation of new ice upstreams will push older ice, that is 
	actually called Calving, you can see very sharp ice slobs.
	Glacier shrinkage happens when ice melts from the borders upwards,
	so you cannot really have calving at the same time as melting.

	article on that paper.
	Much papers are written to say micro plastics are everywhere
	but adverse effects other than their presence is <strong>not</strong>
	well known. Far too many assumptions are made about plastic
	danger and damage to the environment, specially plastic fibers,
	without almost any factual support. Most plastic types are
	chemically inert and should not present further problems other
	than their physical property of dimension and scale.
	At least the authors recognise that climate change may not have
	to do with plastics in the following passage:
	
	<q>5. Capitalize on public interest and concern for the problems
	associated with plastic waste to raise the profile of greater,
	if less tangible, environmental concerns such as climate change
	and biodiversity loss</q>

	in which they mean to using plastic controversy in favor of
	awareness of other more tangible and bigger problems. This is
	probably a <em>neutral paper</em> because I cannot agree
	with some of their statements about higher-level implications
	for the environment, but mostly this an effort of a step in
	the right direction for science.

	</dt>
	<dd>Mrs Zharkova is a solar physicist.
	She has got
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_yqIj38UmY">one lecture</a>
	on youtube and I find very good.
	That is a shame how her paper was retracted by the
	Editors of Nature. I found their retraction note a lame excuse to try and
	<strong>censor her paper</strong>!
	Fortunately we have got links from
	<a href="https://sci-hub.tw/10.1038/s41598-019-45584-3">another source</a>;
	Mrs Zharkova has given alternative links to her paper
	in the comments section of her retracted paper at Nature's website, too,
	and she will publish the paper again soon.
	<br>
	Her paper is actually good, she describes the
	<strong>Sun Inertial Motion</strong>(SIM). As the sun orbits
	the mass centre of the solar system (barycenter) a little
	independently of Earth's and other planets barycenter orbits,
	the star and the planets come closer together and farther apart
	every amount of years. Currently, the sun comes closer to
	Earth at a rate of 0.00025 <abbr title="Astronomical Unit, which is represented by a ``fixed'' Sun-Earth distance">au</abbr>
	per 100 years until 2700. This will warm the baseline Earth
	temperature in 0.5º C every 100 years, but other forcings will
	be stacked on top, in such a way the current grand solar minimum,
	which started in 2019, will last until 2055 and is going to be
	similar to the Maunder Minimum.

	<q>WE ARE NOT TO BLAME! According to the Vostok Ice Core
	Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth's overall
	temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000
	years. That means that our current CO2 levels are the result
	of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago, which
	coincides with the Medieval Warm Period (950-1250 CE). World
	leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in
	the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to
	blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt
	in order to be able to afford to "fight" climate change, an
	unstoppable natural cycle. The warming pattern follows the
	increase and decrease in sun spots, a 22-year-cycle. What we
	may need are commercial solutions that will aid in the
	survival of the human race throughout the coming centuries.</q>
