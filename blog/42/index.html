<!-- SUMMARY IN ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE -->

<div lang="pt" class="p-summary">
<p>Notas sobre o último episódio da temporada do podcast. Não
conseguimos abordar todos os assuntos, mas tem bastante conteúdo e
histórias..</p>
</div>

<br>
<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->

<p>I am not sure how to script out this podcast, but I sure want to
record one more episode.</p>

<p>Actually, I did try recording a last episode for this podcast
season, but I decided to try to broadcast a live event on YouTube
with Streamlabs (Android) and lost the stream (about 36min) because
Streamlabs was not able to stream to YouTube. Didn't warn it in a
way I could understand before ending the event.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Sync news about YouTube channel (removed) and this website
future developments (or lack of)</dt>

<dd>Just go over the subjects on blog posts <a href=
"../38/">#38</a> and <a href="../39/">#39</a>.</dd>

<dt>Plans for a future Season 1 of my podcast.</dt>

<dd>The second season (Season 1) of the podcast may be in English.
If so, episodes will be shorter and I will need planning a little
more for each episode as I fear my spoken English may be rather
rusty..</dd>

<dt>Getting my parents vaccinated and Covid</dt>

<dd>Dad vaccination went OK but mum was not able to have ser second
shot, yet. We met some funny people while waiting on queues..</dd>

<dt>Politics, public contests and jobs</dt>

<dd>Cannot really say there is a <em>complete</em> lack of jobs but
that is not a simple subject.. Some political notes.</dd>

<dt>Bitcoin price, Elon Musk and Hodling</dt>

<dd>Just to make sure I think Elon Musk is not making such good
decisions anymore.. Comments about hodling.</dd>

<dt>Climate Summit</dt>

<dd>USA is back, promises to cut emissions by 50% until 2050.
Leader, some other countries try to follow suit. Bill Gates is an
arse.
<br>
I wish these powerful people, not intelligent people, would talk
about vanquishing hunger, illness and poverty. As it is, that
summit is ridiculous.

<em>Unfortunately, this topic was not covered in this
episode..</em></dd>

<dt>Becoming an activist by accident, Clintel and Heartland</dt>

<dd>There may some powerful people looking for me. They want to

<em>Unfortunately, this topic was not covered in this
episode..</em></dd>

<dt>Defeating my vices</dt>

<dd>I am glad I don't do hard drugs, such as cocaine. But alcohol,
tobacco and Marijuana may also become a big problem, specially when
these vices lock together.
<br>
There are some YouTube references which are helping me a lot:

<br>
<a hreflang="pt" href=
"https://www.youtube.com/c/DaviSilvaCoachAddiction/videos">Davi
Silva Coach Addiction</a>
<br>
This last one channel (Davi's) is helping me a lot because he has
got new techniques to help defeat addictions. For example, he says
we should not keep thinking alcoholism is a disease and that we
shall be ill of it for ever. Such thoughts just make us depressed.
Better not to think too much of our own addiction and try to keep
on the recovery path. Also, better not to keep talking too much
about addiction. We want to be free of addictions and forget to
talk about it.</dd>

<dt>Mushrooms and Psychedelics</dt>

<dd>Talk about mushroom trip stories from some years back and
<em>maybe</em> we should aim to have another mushroom trip <em>some
time</em>. But before that, we need the appropriate <em>date, set
and setting</em>.</dd>
