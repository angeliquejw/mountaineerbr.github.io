<p>Google has got a nice feature for defining a search date range.
I always use that for checking papers, articles and writings in
general. Older papers are usually better written and more
thoughtful.</p>

<p>Some general problems become bolder as telecommunication
technology evolves. Communication and data publishing changed
dramatically, in such a way it is reaches a bigger proportion of
people in less time. It may be appropriately to say a more fluid
mode as opposed to crystallise thoughts or rationales. Perhaps that
would be called a more <cite>fluid reality</cite> by Zygmunt
Bauman..</p>

<p>To publishing an article on the internet, if one has got some
basic connections, writing a piece and publishing that can be an
almost immediate event.</p>

<p>Even unthoughtful one-liners can mess up general opinion. Take
Brazil's <a href="https://twitter.com/jairbolsonaro">president
Bolsonaro</a>, whose sons publish a lot of obscenities in his name
and in the name of the Republic at Twitter.</p>

<p>That is how people are getting used to ever more, writing very
short text. Incomplete text should be called note and as such a
collection of notes are not organised very much, by definition.</p>

<p>Also, size of a text does not mean it is better or worse than a
shorter text, although usually the shorter the harder to
understand.</p>

<p>There is too much of the same ideas, ever poorer modification of
existing bases for some unhelpful sophistication of one own
creativity.</p>

<p>That may not be a new problem, however that is for certain more
common now quantitatively than before, when a researcher wants to
conform to general opinion, fearing cuts in research budgets or
even salary. An overflow of limits means the paper may be under
serious methodological problems when that suffices to say there is
<q>consensus</q> and one's research confirms consensus.
<br>
Consensus should not be more important than a very well defined and
rational function, which leverages logical deduction of further
general aspects.</p>

<p>I reckon Einstein's genius may be in great part due to the fact
of the environment he was brought up in, and also because of his
acknowledgement and decision of developing on top of very important
primitives defined by other scientists. Synthesis is harder than
analysis, one needs a general understanding of the overall picture
and be able to remove noise from what is really important.</p>

<p>I am not sure it is healthy to long to be like Einstein. Francis
Crick and Ken Thompson would agree. Ken would probably also say to
just do your own thing, no need to have got bigger perspectives
than what is feasible at the time.</p>

<hr>

<p>I fear this post has developed into something else than the
title may strictly suggest. Indeed writing about Einstein made me
question what are my objectives with this website and my youtube
channel, anyways? Too much thinking, I will just leave it at that
for now.</p>

<hr>

<p>News about the website. I changed website structure a little
more. There are two important directories in the website structure
which are the graphics <i>'gfx'</i> and resources <i>'res'</i>
directories. The res directory will hold anything that is not
graphical, such as audio or text, although PDFs could arguably be
placed in the gfx directory, too.</p>

<p>A robots.txt file was added to the home page directory. It has
not got much, of importance only a pointer to a sitemap file.</p>

<p>I am using two scripts from Poor Man's Webmaster Tools to make a
<i>sitemap.txt</i> and a <i>sitemap.html</i> files. While I will
soon link the sitemap.html to visitors in the home page, Google,
Bing, Yahoo! Search, DuckDuckGo and other engines will actually
prefer to read a <em>sitemap.xml</em> file, because it can hold
some information about the links, such as last update time, update
frequency and priority (this latter is not currently consumed by
Google bots as explicitly said in Google's website).</p>

<p>It was not much hard to make the third sitemap script which
generates a xml file last night, although it took me approximately
2-3 hours to write it.. Here is a <a href=
"../res/script6.html">static copy of the script</a>. Although I
will be improving it over time, it may serve as <em>an example</em>
for some other person who reads this here.</p>

<p>The <strong>sitemap.xml</strong> file should actually be
uploaded to these search engines (they have got a form for that),
but I reckon if you are patient, you can just add the sitemap
pointer to the robots.txt and the robots will eventually reach
that.</p>
