<p>Como comento bastante nos parágrafos abaixo, é complicado eu
replicar o mesmo conteúdo em português e inglês. Apesar da intenção
deste site ser para anotações de pesquisas e ideas, assim como
coleção de listas de links de referência para uso pessoal em
momento futuro, também é para ser compartilhado com interessados, e
seria uma pena não usar o Inglês para tentar atingir o maior número
de pessoas ao redor do mundo. De modo que decidi escrever os textos
em qualquer língua, porém sem compromissos ou promessas.</p>

<p>Há um texto meu em português com memórias e algumas histórias de
minhas aventuras no Japão, onde cursei um ano e meio do ensino
médio na escola internato <a hreflang="en" lang="ja" href=
"https://www.meitoku-gijuku.ed.jp/english/">Meitoku Gijuku</a>, o
que mudou muito o meu caráter e meu modo de ver as coisas.. Veja

<p>This is the last day of August. Today, I am trying to
consolidate my health-wise plans for September. My routine needs
improvement, it is already much better than it was between
2014-2017, but sometimes I fail my plans and that may lead me to
some bad days too easily. That is what needs improvement, more
resistance to a routine which can keep my frustrations in
check.</p>

<p>Anyways, Luke Smith has got a video in which he explains how he
manages his website. he has got a cloud Debian server server in
which 'nginx' is installed.. The programme is called 'engine ex'
and is a web server. In this website, I am doing everything
manually and carefully, for example, all subdirectories will need
have an index.html file in order for their contents not to be
visible as raw file hierarch, even if that must be a
403-forbidden-type index.html..</p>

<p>There are other more important steps I could do at leisure
first, for example, renting a custom domain for the website and a
better place to host that than GitHub..</p>

<p>An important point is to decide what language this website will
be. I reckon that would be a shame not to use English as a
practical means for exposing content to the wide world web, however
most people I know speak only Portuguese. There is just so much
time and effort I can put into this website, and as much of the
purpose of creating this is for my recordings of research and
ideas, collating references and links for easily accessing them
later, just as much my intent is to share and spread these writings
with everyone else.
<br>
That leaves me in a difficult position but it is decided I will
write in whichever language, but I cannot promise as much content
in both languages. I hope this is may serve as stimulus for those
who would like to read more of my posts. It may also be useful,
there may be some information I would rather not expose in either
English or Portuguese..</p>

<p>I know a little Japanese, too. That was the biggest movement of
my life when I went to Japan and lived in <a hreflang="en" lang=
"ja" href="https://www.meitoku-gijuku.ed.jp/english/">Meitoku
Gijuku</a>, a boarding school, for one year and a half. There is a
long recollection text in portuguese I wrote just before leaving
Japan. That is hosted online at the blog A Viagem de ShigueS
