<p>Depois de ver dar uma olhada melhor no <a hreflang="en" href=
"https://lukesmith.xyz/blog">blog do Luke Smith</a>, estou pensando
em copiar algumas seções, como por exemplo, inaugurar um podcast em
<b>Português</b>. Definitivamente, o meu conteúdo vai ter que ser
espalhado em duas línguas. Veja, por exemplo, meu canal
<a hreflang="pt" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/XGnuBio">canal no
YouTube</a>, totalmente em português.. A ideia de um podcast é
muito boa pois abre uma avenida de possibilidades, além de ser mais
fácil de gravar, quem sabe um episódio por mês.. Aguardem..</p>
</div>

<br>

<p><a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/blog">Luke Smith's blog</a> has
nice posts about his website development. Specially, today, I was
reading the very first posts, from may 2008, and he states
preference for a minimalist website. There is also depth to his
website, browsing it I could find many links to different sections
of his website: video, podcast and rss feed. He has got even a
forum, which I avoided entering so far, may check it later. That
<a href="https://larbs.xyz/">LARBS</a> distribution seems to have
many users. I would't dare using it, because that would be one more
layer -- instead of having to learn how to configure the tools
themselves, I would have to learn how to configure his
<cite>LARBS</cite> tools.. And I just found how convoluted his
distro design might be, look at how redundant is this directory
structure, which he cites in <a href=
"https://lukesmith.xyz/blog/font-gone-crazy-in-larbs">this post</a>
in which you navigate downwards levels until you can find the
distro default configuration file at
<code>~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code>.</p>

<p>His website has very interesting ideas, pages and depth to
content. Specially, the podcast section got my attention. I already
have got a <a hreflang="pt" href=
"https://www.youtube.com/c/XGnuBio">YouTube channel</a> (in
portuguese), and some faithful followers, even though I advertise
that channel as a B-side channel, meaning produced with as little
time as would afford that.. However, a podcast, in which only the
voice is the most important piece of the play, seems like good fun.
That is easier to record, easy to upload, easy to download.. It can
have high quality sound as any mobile phone has great microphone,
much different from my computer microphone used for producing my
youtube channel content!</p>

<p>It would make sense to have my podcast in portuguese, which
means effectively splitting content in two languages in this
website. Production would be slower, one episode a month. And I
could have co-hosts or interviews, chatting with other cool people,
so that is a big opened avenue.</p>
