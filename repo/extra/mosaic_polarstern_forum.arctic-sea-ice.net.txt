MOSAiC news

« on: September 11, 2019, 11:43:21 AM »
The MOSAiC expedition begins on the Sep20.

Quote

    MOSAiC - Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic
    Climate

    It could be the largest-scale Arctic research expedition of all time: in
    September 2019 the German research icebreaker Polarstern will depart from
    Tromsø, Norway and, once it has reached its destination, will spend the
    next year drifting through the Arctic Ocean, trapped in the ice. A total of
    600 people from 19 countries, who will be supplied by other icebreakers and
    aircraft, will participate in the expedition – and several times that
    number of researchers will subsequently use the data gathered to take
    climate and ecosystem research to the next level. The mission will be
    spearheaded by the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and
    Marine Research (AWI).


The expedition programme is here

Quote

    A CTD or Sonde is an oceanography instrument used to measure the
    conductivity, temperature, and pressure of seawater (the D stands for
    "depth," which is closely related to pressure). The reason to measure
    conductivity is that it can be used to determine the salinity.

    Meereises vorherzusagen. Mit Hilfe des AWI-Vorhersagesystems (Sea Ice
    Outlook) werden möglichen Eisbedingungen (Eisbedeckung und Eisdicke) in der
    geplanten Startregion bestimmt und erklärt wie dieses System die
    Routenplanung von FS Polarstern unterstützen kann. In einem zweiten Beitrag
    wird eine Analyse der möglichen Drift der MOSAiC-Station im Winter 2019/20
    durch die zentrale Arktis, basierend auf Drift Satellitendaten der
    vergangenen dreizehn Jahre beschrieben. Weiterhin berichtet bis zum Beginn
    des Drift-Experimentes, wenn FS Polarstern an einer geeigneten
    Meereisscholle festgemacht und das Camp aufgebaut worden ist, der
    AWI-Meereisticker zweimal wöchentlich über die Eisbedingungen in der Arktis
    und die Route, die FS Polarstern nehmen wird.

    Im Datenportal von meereisportal.de ist ein spezieller MOSAiC-Bereich
    www.meereisportal/mosaic/daten/ aufgebaut worden, in dem unterschiedliche
    tagesaktuelle Karten, Daten und Zusatzinformationen zur Expedition rund um
    das Thema Meereis dargestellt sind und auch heruntergeladen werden können.

13 drift estimates based on 2005-2017drift starting from 14 different locations
within the start area by Dr Thomas Krumpen. The start location is marked with a
star.
Quote

    Polarstern drift

    The ship’s potential drift route can be roughly estimated in advance by
    reconstructing the course that the ice followed from the starting point in
    past years. This involves the use of satellite data, which depicts the ice
    drift in the Arctic on a daily basis. The analytical tool used for the ice
    drift is called IceTrack and was developed at the AWI. In addition to
    various types of satellite data (ice drift, ice concentration, ice
    thickness), reanalysis data – which provides insights into temperature,
    wind speed and atmospheric pressure in the Arctic – is taken into account.
    In this way, not only the ice drift in the past years can be reconstructed
    for individual potential starting points, but all key atmospheric factors
    influencing the ice can also be included. A comprehensive description of
    these methods was recently released in connection with a study that
    investigated changes in the Transpolar Drift as a result of global warming
    (source: Nature).

    The data portal displays drift scenarios for various potential starting
    points. Each figure shows the drift trajectories for the years 2005 – 2017
    for the respective starting point (e.g. 85°N / 130°E). For the purposes of
    the drift analysis, the starting date is always 1 October of the respective
    year. The ice’s progress in the course of a year is reconstructed using the
    IceTrack algorithm, and the calculation is only stopped when the ice cover
    at the respective position drops below a certain threshold (50 %), at which
    point we have to assume that the MOSAiC ice floe would have melted. The
    colours used for the trajectories symbolise the month for the respective
    position.

The mosaic website provides a link to the International Arctic Buoy Programme.
Daily data from the buoy table is available here http://iabp.apl.washington.edu
/maps_daily_table.html

Quote

    For buoys that are still reporting, raw plots of the data are available by
    clicking the buoy's id. More detailed plots are available for buoys that
    have stopped reporting. These more detailed plots include satellite derived
    buoy quantities such as surface temperature and ice concentration, and also
    reanalysis quantities from MERRA, including atmospheric temperature. The
    reanalysis products actually use buoy data in their calculations, but they
    have expert filtering techniques for eliminating the use of bad data in
    their final product. Comparing raw buoy data to their final product is
    therefore a good way of estimating buoy data quality, though differences
    between the interpolated field and any particular buoy data value is to be
    expected.

    All data provided here are raw, and only include quatities of atmospheric
    interest: Sea Level Pressure (BP), Surface Temperature (Ts), and
    Atmospheric Temperature(Ta). Many buoys also contain interesting ice and
    ocean quantities, accessible via their respective sites. IMBs have high
    resolution temperature readings of the ice layer, for example, while
    UpTempOs typically have a 60m thermistor string to sample ocean
    temperatures. ITPs actually profile the water column down to 500m or more.

    In addition to the SIMBs there will be other buoys studying the atmosphere,
    ocean, and ice motion.

    Our data will be available in near real-time

    After a decade of preparations, it’s finally time: this evening at 8:30
    p.m. the German icebreaker Polarstern will depart from the Norwegian port
    of Tromsø. Escorted by the Russian icebreaker Akademik Fedorov, she will
    set sail for the Central Arctic. On board researchers will investigate a
    region that is virtually inaccessible in winter, and which is crucial for
    the global climate. They will gather urgently needed data on the
    interactions between the atmosphere, ocean and sea ice, as well as on the
    ecosystem. Thanks to the collaboration between international experts, the
    one-year-long ice drift past the North Pole will take climate research to a
    completely new level.

During the beginning of PS122 (mosaic) the Russian research icebreaker Akademik
Fedorov from the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) will join
Polarstern.

The Polarstern’s companion vessel, the Akademik Fedorov has ‘been there, done
that’. On 2 August 2007, it reached the North Pole with 100 scientists and
researchers and two deep sea mini-submarines where the scientists dove to a
depth of more than 13,200 feet (4,000 m) to collect sediment cores.

Some background history while icebreakers are in transit.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drifting_ice_station
Quote

    An idea to use the drift ice for the exploration of nature in the high
    latitudes of the Arctic Ocean belongs to Fridtjof Nansen, who fulfilled it
    on Fram between 1893 and 1896. The first stations to use drift ice as means
    of scientific exploration of the Arctic originated in the Soviet Union in
    1937, when the first such station in the world, North Pole-1, started
    operations.[1]

    North Pole-1 was established on May 21, 1937 some 20 km from the North Pole
    by the expedition into the high latitudes. Sever-1, led by Otto Schmidt.
    "NP-1" operated for 9 months, during which the ice floe travelled 2,850
    kilometres. On February 19, 1938, Soviet ice breakers Taimyr and Murman
    took off four polar explorers from the station, who immediately became
    famous in the USSR and were awarded titles Hero of the Soviet Union:
    hydrobiologist Pyotr Shirshov, geophysicist Yevgeny Fyodorov, radioman
    Ernst Krenkel and their leader Ivan Papanin.

    Since 1954 Soviet "NP" stations worked continuously, with one to three such
    stations operating simultaneously each year. The total distance drifted
    between 1937 and 1973 was over 80,000 kilometres. North Pole-22 is
    particularly notable for its record drift, lasting nine years. On June 28,
    1972 the ice floe with North Pole-19 passed over the North Pole for the
    first time ever.

    During such long-term observations by "NP" stations, a lot of important
    discoveries in physical geography were made, valuable conclusions on
    regularities and the connection between processes in the polar region of
    the Earth's hydrosphere and atmosphere were obtained. Some of the most
    important discoveries were finding the deep-water Lomonosov Ridge,[2] which
    crosses the Arctic Ocean, other large features of the ocean bottom's
    relief, the discovery of two systems of the drift (circular and
    "wash-out"), the fact of cyclones' active penetration into the Central
    Arctic.

More background on ice drift expeditions, 2014:

Alone on an Arctic ice floe, with a hovercraft
By Carolyn Gramling Sep. 12, 2014
https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/09/alone-arctic-ice-floe-hovercraft
[sn-hovercraftH]
Somewhere in the Arctic Ocean, two Norwegian scientists are adrift on an ice
floe, equipped with a year’s worth of food and fuel—and one research hovercraft
named SABVABAA (Inuit for “flows swiftly over it”). University of Bergen/Nansen
Environmental and Remote Sensing Center professor emeritus Yngve Kristoffersen,
72, and crew member Audun Tholfsen established ice drift station FRAM-2014/15
on the 1.1-meter-thick floe on 30 August, when it was 280 kilometers from the
North Pole. Over the next few months, they will drift northward along the
submarine Lomonosov Ridge, taking sediment cores to learn about the polar
environment more than 60 million years ago. It’s the hovercraft that makes the
setup truly unique: Using SABVABAA, the researchers can travel up to 100
kilometers from their floating base, assessing ice properties, currents, and
water temperatures. The hovercraft—the brainchild of Kristoffersen and
physicist John Hall, 74, of the Geological Survey of Israel—also makes it
possible to conduct a year-round study, Hall says. The ridge is covered by
thick multiyear ice, forbidding to icebreakers, but SABVABAA (pictured) “allows
you to have boots on the ground.”

Amazing image! Makes the CAB look like a breeding ground for ice to get just
thick enough to where it feeds the ice (perhaps?) still subject to “melting
conditions” in the peripheral seas. That really tells a nice overall tale of
the importance of the Arctic Summer (>85N perhaps) and also it’s “winter”. It
seems like it and perhaps the Greenland sea will be some of the holdout places
perhaps as Arctic sea ice extent (ASI) continues its death spiral overall.

It may still be a little early to use SMOS as a reliable indicator of
thickness. Interference around the 'pole hole' should probably be largely
ignored. Also note that the SMOS 50cm thickness contour follows some of the
weather 'interference' shown by ascat, which is too fast to be related to a
thickness change.
Quote

    SMOS

    The thickness of thin sea ice (SIT) is daily retrieved from observations of
    the L-band microwave sensor SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity).
    Horizontal and vertical polarized brightness temperatures in the incidence
    angle range of 40° to 50° are averaged. The ice thickness is then inferred
    from the polarization difference and the intensity using an empirical
    method (Huntemann et al., 2014).

    Thin sea ice occurs during the freezing season. In the melting season, the
    thickness of sea ice is highly variable and the emission properties in the
    microwave change due to the wetness of the surface and occurrence of melt
    ponds in the Arctic. Therefore, thickness data are calculated only during
    the freezing season, that is from October to April in the Arctic and from
    March to September in the Antarctic. During the melting season, the
    procedure does not yield meaningful results.

    As the resolution of SMOS at the used incidence angle range is about 40 km,
    only larger regions of thin ice will be retrieved correctly. The rim of
    thin ice shown in many cases not necessarily indicates thin ice, but can
    also be caused by the smearing effect (convolution) of the low resolution.

    Each day of ice thickness data product are calculated twice to ensure that
    all swath files were available in the archived product. First processing is
    done directly on the next day with only about 7 hours delay. At this time
    it can happen that not all swath files are available and another processing
    of the same day is initiated 23 hours later. In more than 50% of the time
    the first processing does not include all swath but usually provides
    sufficient coverage for Arctic and Antarctic regions.

    This service has been developed in the framework of the EU project SIDARUS.
    After completion of the SIDARUS project end 2013, the service is continued
    on a best effort base in the context of the Polar View and of the Arctic
    Regional Ocean Observing System (Arctic ROOS).

The ice edge is likely to move south slowly this year until SST's are lower. It
will be interesting to see some 'on the ice' measurements from mosaic when they
find a thick enough floe to moor to.

A closer look at polarstern's locations sep26-27 and this quote from the
itinerary
Quote

    As part of the journey the four moorings of Vera Schlindwein (DE.AWI) that
    are located in the area 82°N and 119°E will need to be collected


Hopefully they are successful in locating and collecting the four Gakkel Ridge
micro-seismic moorings. A previous paper by Vera Schlindwein here
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/
255586449_Microseismicity_of_the_ultraslow-spreading_Gakkel_ridge_Arctic_Ocean_A_pilot_study
Quote

    The active mid-ocean ridge of the Arctic Ocean, named Gakkel ridge, is the
    slowest spreading ridge of the global system of mid-oceanic ridges with
    full spreading rates declining from about 12.5 to 6 mm yr-1 from west to
    east. Geological models of seafloor spreading predict a decreasing
    intensity of magmatic processes with decreasing spreading rate. In summer
    2001, the multidisciplinary Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge Expedition (AMORE2001)
    discovered robust magmatism at western Gakkel ridge, an amagmatic section
    further east and pronounced volcanic centres at eastern Gakkel ridge.

AMSR2 concentration is a great product but doesn't scale well to Sentinel1
resolution. Meereisportal are now providing a version of the multisensor map
without the overlay

sep25-26, small.
It's a real bonus from this expedition already that we can now see clear daily
Sentinel1 coverage of this area.

Polarstern in the startup area, maybe taking a look at the darker floe due
north. It looks like the only candidate at the moment on the multisensor no

Hopefully they will reduce the triangle size at some point or make it semi
transparent.

    The team of #MOSAiCexpedition takes first steps on the sea ice. They left #
    Polarstern to deploy a buoy which will provide them data about drift and
    meteorological conditions. You can
    follow the buoy at https://www.meereisportal.de


Meerisportal links to http://iabp.apl.washington.edu/maps_daily_table.html
where there are 2 new buoys reporting from day 272 with rather conflicting data
(Ts=surface temperature, Ta=atmospheric temperature)
Quote

    Note that "Surface Temperature (Ts)" is measured from the bottom of the
    buoy hull. If the buoy is floating, then the reported temperature is of the
    sea surface. If the buoy is frozen into the ice, or sitting on top of it,
    then the reported temperature is of the ground or ice. The freezing
    temperature of sea water is about -1.8C, so temperature readings below this
    indicate ground or ice temperatures.

Hopefully they will provide a link to more data on their own site at some point

edit:polarstern hasn't been that far north yet
Akademik Fedorov doesn't report location to sailwx.
edit2: More new buoy data further down the list (-999 means no report)

    This search for a suitable floe is ongoing


This has become a common problem for placing instruments on the Arctic ice. It
also means measurements are being done under unrepresentative conditions.

Using sampling to ultimately estimate the conditions of the entire Arctic via
statistical analysis requires representative (usually random) sampling but this
is no longer possible. The result is likely over estimation of sea ice
thickness and stability.

Mosaic is a fantastic endeavor that will provide a massive amount of
observational data via an incredible array of modern instrumentation (relative
to the last go-round, SHEBA, of 1999). Results will dominate the scientific
literature on the Arctic Ocean for years to come because the interior basin has
heretofore largely gone un-instrumented.

Mosaic will greatly improve the interpretability of satellite imagery and
provide a reality check on model predictions never regularly confronted with
observation. Just having real weather assimilated into daily ECMWF
initializations is a huge step forward over meagre shoreline inputs, for
example measured 2m winds responsible for icepack motion and export.

Ice-atmosphere couplings (eg radiative balance, boundary layer turbulent flux,
cloud properties) depend on location and weather, not on the floe selected.
While the Polarstern provides the center of observation, the secondary
deployments go out a radius of 40 km. With drift, this generate a swath of
measurements nearly a degree of latitude wide (111 km) wide, rather than point
data (mooring) or line data (buoy).

The second study component is the ice itself. It has not yet proved possible to
determine ice mass balance issues (thickness, bottom growth, melt ponds)
year-round with any accuracy from remote sensing, much less modeling, so the
comprehensive thicknesses will be a real breath of fresh air.

The third focus is water column under the ice. The anticipated drift across the
Eurasian Basin does not seem ideal for the study of encroaching Atlantification
(like N-ICE2015 or the PS's recent visit to the upper Fram), though the
northern Laptev is an area of very active concern for mixing of thermal and
saline stratifications.

It's never been clear what provides the vast volumes of return water to the
East Greenland Current because the Waddell Sea and points north have been under
thick ice for ages. Mosaic has an acoustic tomography experiment going relative
to new moorings that can address this.

Mosaic planners knew from the outset that finding a suitable floe would be
mission-critical. They allocated a full week for that search; as I write, the
ship has been at N 85°12' E 134°18' for eight hours. They are looking for 1.2 m
or thicker ice, a port-side mooring for logistics, and a large enough floe so
that electricity and LAN data lines can reach remote instrumentation.

The safety issues involve pressure ridges heaving experimental set-ups, leads
opening suddenly, nearby floes over-rafting, patches of very thin ice, strong
swells from remote storms, aggressive [DEL:penguins:DEL] walruses and bears,
plus working long hours in cold, dark and possibly very windy conditions. (The
PS serves alcohol at two on-board bars.)

I am skeptical -- based on the multi-satellite September time series below --
that they will find the perfect floe at 85ºN because the Laptev is in such poor
condition but if they go much farther towards the Pole, there may not be
notable net drift towards the Fram.

The gif below shows Osisaf, Ascat and Smos embedded within a novel differential
AMSR2. The complex palette is provided in the lower left corner. The Polarstern
search wedge, called a spherical rectangle or section double frustrum, is shown
as an overlay (map adornment) for each satellite. The base resolution is 6.25
km/pxl for AMSR2 unchanged from archive.

With so much data coming in so many forms, synchronized integration becomes
increasingly important in science-retaining visualizations. While this one was
easy enough to make, it doesn't roll forward because of the differencing wrt a
fixed final day, 30 Sep 19.

Hello A-Team! Your posts are always welcome. Astounding visualization.

I was wondering if Mosaic might make their thickness measurements available. I
am more interested in the many floes they skip, rather than the one floe they
finally select (if they even manage to find a suitable one). I see this a a
very rare opportunity to compare direct local measurements to SMOS remote
sensing and to PIOMAS modelling.

That pallette highlights another fracture along the Lomonosov ridge from
sep24-26 which I hadn't noticed before. These are not frequent, but not
uncommon either. It's possible that they'll be drifting in that direction.

update on PS location and temps, looks like more buoys, 29 currently on the

Not real helpful to tweet a buoy picture without furnishing its identifying
number and capabilities.

Here is a very nice site hosting SIMB3 buoy data. The founding engineers were
graduate students with Don Perovich at Dartmouth so it is safe to assume robust
design standards were used in manufacturing these buoys. The Polarstern has not
yet deployed its four. There is one just launched in the Beaufort (IMEI:
386840), that is showing just 90 cm of ice well in from the periphery. The
first figure shows condensed hightlights of this site. Hopefully someone here
can explore the embedded graphics option that they offer.

The Polarstern is carrying 14 other buoys with tracking csvl provided by APL at
UW. These are active but have not yet gathered much data.
http://iabp.apl.washington.edu/maps_daily_table.html

@Zlabe has some great new summary graphics for the Arctic which I combined with
an Ascat and Polerstern location wedge.. These show that the air and water are
anomalously warm for September.

Here is that active SIMB3 buoy in the Beaufort. It is not exactly part of the
Mosaic expedition though it seems Perovich is [DEL:sailing steaming:DEL]
dieseling on the Polarstern. As noted, the ice plus snow is not yet a meter
thick. meaning the ice alone is thinner still.

Buoy data are better plotted in polar stereographic than mercator-like
projections. The meridian is very easy to find using AMSR2 UHH because it has a
1º longitude graticule on its outside, easily exposed by picking land-red and
deleting to alpha in a blank floating layer.

To intersect with the latitude, the base map has a scale of 839 pixels out to
75º which pencils out to 59.33 pixels per degree. So just multiple by buoy
latitude and draw a circle out that many pixels, fill the boundary. Then place
the star on the actual AMSR2 layer according to the floating layer.

    Oren: wondering if Mosaic might make their thickness measurements
    available. I am more interested in the many floes they skip, rather than
    the one floe they finally select

I had that same question because we have long been starved for real ice
thicknesses. I wrote the help desk but the 'Send' button wasn't operative.
Those EMbirds measure distance to the surface and distance to the saltwater
very accurately and with excellent horizontal resolution. On N-ICE2015, they
timed the flights to coincide with the satellite overpass and spot surface
drilling.

They may not retain the data after rejecting the floe, not feel it is properly 
calibrated, or not have the bandwidth to send it ashore. Iridium data packets
from buoys are a few hundred bytes (if you can remember what those were).

On the selected floe, which will likely be a fused composite of floes with
different histories, they are planning a comprehensive 4D study of its
thickness and freeze thaw cycle from above and below. So hopefully an
interactive 3D model like we see for some of the Greenland glaciers.

The PS has still not found its floe but must be in a promising area because
they have been lingering along 85º for several days. They haven't missed much
TPD; OsiSaf had a couple of days of that but today the ice is back floundering
about as it did all summer.

@zlabe attributes this to the persistent negative (N)AO and lack of seasonal
polar vortex transition. Useful references as the atmosphere transitions to the
NH wintertime circulation:

Can someone here explain what significance the dew point has in these
circumstances? Or do they just collect it because that's easier than not
collecting it?

I am still anxiously awaiting data from those four. However Polarstern does at

    We finally found the piece of ice that will be the home for Polarstern for
    the next year. It’s a floe a few kilometers in diameter and with thickness
    ranging from half a meter to a few meters.

A closer look at 4 of them.[DEL: Dates:DEL] A time series will be useful when
it's a bit clearer what is happening. Some of this looks like drift, some of it
delivery. All the scales are different here to maximise the image size.

I am also wondering if and when IceSat-2 data is going to be part of an
integrated data suite.

http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/
Laser_precision_NASA_Flights_satellite_align_over_sea_ice_999.html
Laser precision: NASA Flights, satellite align over sea ice
Quote

    In April, instruments aboard NASA's Operation IceBridge airborne campaign
    and the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 succeeded in measuring
    the same Arctic sea ice at the same time, a tricky feat given the shifting
    sea ice. Scientists have now analyzed airborne and spaceborne height
    measurements, and found that the two datasets match almost exactly,
    demonstrating how precisely ICESat-2 can measure the heights of the sea
    ice's bumpy, cracked surface.

    Sea ice height profiles from ICESat-2 can tell scientists whether the ice
    is a newly formed, smooth surface or an older, rougher section. The key
    measurement from ICESat-2, however, is how high the ice surface is above
    the open water, called freeboard. If scientists know that number, they can
    calculate the thickness - which isn't directly measured from satellite
    data. When Kwok and his colleagues compared freeboard measurements from
    ICESat-2 and Operation IceBridge's Airborne Topographic Mapper instrument
    for the April flights, they were within 0.8 to 1.6 inches (2 to 4
    centimeters) of each other.

    With additional flights over land and sea ice in both Greenland and
    Antarctica this fall, Operation IceBridge is continuing to help assess
    ICESat-2 data, along with other efforts including the third year of an
    Antarctic ground traverse along a section of the 88 degree South line of
    latitude.

Nice spotting, Jim. Now if we only had a list of all urls from the people on
board tweeting or posting to home institution blogs, we could keep up a lot
better.

https://www.bnl.gov/mosaic/ collects posts from Brookhaven NL and posts some
very nice photos. They are going to have a huge problem initially with polar
bears because those are highly concentrated near the Laptev sea ice edge where
the food is, rather than swimming around in 1000 km patch of open ocean.

Hopefully they can scare the bears off and not shoot them the way drilling
projects on Greenland have done. Walrus have been in the news lately too,
sinking a Russian zodiac near FJL. The Oden photographed a walrus messing with
scientific gear last summer at the North Pole. A walrus thrashed Nansen's
kayaks on the return trip. I don't anticipate any problems with penguins.

I have belatedly realized that a changing hourly PS position report from sailwx
doesn't mean the ship is underway because sea ice drift is of comparable
magnitude to them poking about looking for the perfect floe.

They have fixed the daily ice obliteration on the Sentinel radar; the heavy
triangle is gone and replaced by a too-small circle. It's still opaque though.
The problem is working with one layer; the red route should be done in a second
layer with a transparency slider (a capability offered already in Feb 1990 by
Photoshop 1.0).

The reason I bring this up is we need a very clear radar image of the floe in
order to match it with Sept 21-24 visible Worldview (the last clear sunlit
days) to allow traceback of its origin to early June when Ascat can pick up its
motion back to formation in the fall of 2018.

As Uniq noted earlier, this is best done using the unadorned jp2 file served by
polarview.aq/arctic. It sounds though that the floe can still be photographed
from above in the visible even though WV's growing pole hole blacked out this
latitude and north about ten days ago.

That is, the PS will determine all its current and future properties such as
healed leads, pressure ridges, underwater keels, brine pockets, bottom algae,
sunlight transparency, snow layers, fire soot etc etc.

My expectation is this floe formed as FYI on the periphery of the ice pack
maybe two hundred km north and a bit east of Kotelny Island (NSI). It is not a
piece of MYI from the Beaufort arm, nor related to thick ice between the Pole
and CAA, nor broken-off landfast Siberian ice. It then drifted over the last 11
months, initially along its parallel (ie zonally) but with an admixture of
south meridional this spring, to its current position, graduating to SYI on
Sept 15.

Note the primary floe at 3 km diameter is far short of the 30-40 radius
necessary for the secondary deployments. The adjacent floes, whose leads are
now freezing up, will have a similar provenance. These will thicken but never
attain the structural strength of the main floe. Thus the Polarstern is thus
moored on a future shear line.

I've attached a bit of Norwegian maritime humor because the main Mosaic
planning document shows the PS moored starboard. It is customary for the
captain to be given a green and red sock as mnemonic to avoid collisions with
other transiting vessels.

Following up on earlier observations of FishooW and Zlabe on the unusually
persistent negativity of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) this summer, I
graphed the last 12 months of daily readings. The onset in late May coincided
very closely with the cessation of Fram/Nares export and TransPolar Drift, per
Ascat and OsiSaf. No return to positive winter values is foreseen this month.

TPD drift would be nice but most research programs on the Polarstern don't
require it. A lot of this is Nansen nostalgia (or should I say Sverdrup
nostalgia as he captained the Fram after Nansen abandoned ship).

The Akademik Fedorov is named after a distinguished early participant Yevgeny
Fyodorov (Фёдоров) in the first of many Russian sea ice drift experiments.
(These 'don't count' as not conducted by westerners, any more than Alfred
Wegener, not an American, counts as the 1912 discoverer of plate tectonics
despite a whole book on continental drift.)

Russian scientists landed a plane (no runway) at 89°25′N 78°40′W in May 1937
and drifted 2,850 km over nine months to mid-Greenland where they were
miraculously picked off by icebreakers before the floe melted out. (They
carried a hand-cranked radio so did not depend on a battery charge lasting.)
The PS carries two Piston Bullies to plow airport-smooth runways, along with
innumerable creature comforts, yet millennials on board complain every day
about perceived hardships.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Konstantinovich_Fyodorov
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drifting_ice_station

Some of the AWI documents conflate ice drift on the ocean (entirely
wind-driven) with ice floating down a river (eg annual breakup of MacKenzie). 
Surface currents in the central Arctic Ocean are entirely negligible
(discounting keel-induced local advection). AO tides and tidal currents are
very minor and also irrelevant.

Think of a dry leaf skittering along the sidewalk. It's the wind that carries
the leaf along. The sidewalk itself is not moving. For the Arctic Circumpolar
Boundary Current see:

According to GFS there is a plume of very warm air heading their way from the
North Atlantic in around 5 days or so.

'I hope there will still be a floe for them to attach to come the fall ' .. my
thoughts when this expedition was reported in the 'what's new thread back in
June . Seems my concerns are being realized . I really wish every success to
everyone involved ; in the Arctic , elsewhere and of course here on ASIF .. and
it is a joy to once again welcome A-team back among us .

This is currently the top story on the bbc science page.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-49941340

Hopefully this means the expedition is going to be broadcast to a wider
audience.

Also some good photos of the state of the ice around the ship.

Some good material on that BBC page above. Some highlights are captured below:

"After a brief but intensive search, we've found our home for the months to
come," said expedition leader Prof Markus Rex, from AWI. 

"It may not be the perfect floe but it's the best one in this part of the
Arctic and offers better working conditions than we could have expected after a
warm Arctic summer."

Sixteen locations were scouted with the aid of satellite imagery and
helicopters. A floe measuring 2.5km by 3.5km was eventually chosen.

The ice looks very fractured but that can largely be attributed to two
icebreakers coming in. Freeboard looks fairly minimal but that is hard to
estimate from oblique photos. The snow depth is again ankle-deep (15cm). That
is still enough to insulate the ice somewhat from the cold of the air which has
been running -8 to -12ºC in recent hours.

"Snow is an insulator. Its R-value varies depending on moisture content and
density of the snow granules; but on average snow has an R-value of 1 per inch
— about the same as wood. Twelve inches of snow have roughly the same
insulating value as a 2x4 wall filled with fiberglass insulation." [R value is
a US spec; I don't know what it corresponds to in Euro-land.)

In theory, there should be a timestamp, GPS location, direction of view, etc in
the exif metadata buried in the photo file. However that is routinely scrubbed
or altered during production. The online tools below could not find anything of
interest. Sept 30th dates are indicated but those might be spurious.

The cost of €130m ($150m) of the enormous MOSAiC scientific mission is fairly
modest, very similar to the reported cost of a single RQ-4A Global Hawk BAMS-D
surveillance drone like the one Iran downed in June. The US military budget for
the 2019 year is $693,058,000,000 or enough for 4620 Arctic Mosaic expeditions.

Thanks to Uniq at #74, we can compare the Sentinel-1 images being archived by
Mosaic for ice motion to the originals served at https://polarview.aq/arctic.
(Note #74 includes essential photo ID parameters unlike the Mosaic archive
which is blending multiple dates.)

The image below needs a click to display at its 1190 x 584 pixels 'native'
resolution. The Mosaic image had to be enlarged 300% to more or less match
features which pixelated them terribly.

I found the blue ice motion arrows to be way off the mark both in direction and
speed in comparing 3-4 Oct; they may just be dumbed down OsiSaf which span 48
hours and are not nearly of the needed resolution. Overall ice pack motion is
better followed in Ascat from late Sept to early June.

Mosaic may just have made a temporary archive merely for floe-finding;
hopefully they will settle in soon to better characterization of drift (for
which they plan a large array of GPS units that also measure local pack
deformation). There are quite a few compressible spaces now not fully frozen
over, yet the motion in a 1º x 1º rectangle about the ship is mostly cohesive
(uneven wind stress? weaker ice to the south?).

Sailwx only reports PS position to one decimal degree (~11km) and does not
provide stern-to-bow azimuths needed for tracking ship+floe rotation. The PS
knows very accurately where it is located and pointed but so far we don't where
/if that data is being shared in nrt. However sailwx is hourly whereas S1AB has
at best twice daily temporal resolution.

It's easier to track floe motion in the visible though WorldView has gone dark
and will stay dark into March. However for provenance of the selected floe,
summer dates are needed. Taking some cloud-free days, it proves feasible to
match up Terra to S1 features -- which appear very different at different
wavelengths. If the ice hasn't moved too much, it should still be possible to
find the selected floe in visible. Needs click to enlarge.

Take an inside tour of the Polarstern?

"During the historic meeting of USCGC Healy and Germany's RV Polarstern at the
North Pole on 07 Sept 2015 we had the opportunity to exchange visits.  Both
ships were conducting Arctic GEOTRACES cruises."

http://www.geotraces.org/news-50/news/116-news/
1134-geotraces-arctic-expeditions-successfully-completed

Goddard Institute assembled the last cloud-free visible satellite mosaic of the
Arctic Ocean over Sept 17-23. The PS is shown by a red dot at its selected floe
on 01 Oct 19.

“We’ll have to wait and see if it’s also stable enough to withstand the
autumnal storms that are now brewing,” PI Markus Rex said, adding that the team
is “prepared for all scenarios.”

Right. The ice in the northern Laptev has not really set up yet. They have made
the best possible decision under the circumstances. A lot of laboriously
deployed instrumentation and infrastructure would have to be pulled back on
board in the event of swells, flooding of the floe, ridging or shearing.

I worked out the scale on the Polarview imagery Uniq posted in #74 using the
distance between 85º-86º as 111.67 km in WGS84 ellipsoid which all GPS devices
reference. From the approximate dimension of the selected floe 3.5 x 2.5 km, it
is possible to identify the object as a dark oval on S1 radar.

When the next image surfaces on Polarview, we can use the pair to compute real
non-gridded velocities because the PV file name provides the UTC time the image
was taken to the second.

Right, the big issue now is how fast the Polarstern's safety zone will grow to
the south (towards New Siberian Islands). A buffer for long reach swells would
really improve their situation, as would solidified adjacent ice.

Sept 2019 is an especially unfavorable for late open water/slush in the
northern Laptev mooring area as the PS team is well aware (3rd and 4th
graphics). The latter appends Oct 2018, though that scarcely provides a
prediction for this autumn.

I found some trackable features for Oct 04 back to Sep 21 enveloping the Chosen
Floe (which itself is not so trackable) and was able to follow them back into
Modis/Worldview daylight. The ice has been going around in an aimless circles
with no sign of TransPolar Drift onset. Despite leads opening and closing, this
region of ice has been moving mostly like a rigid block.

Last May, we found the best way to quantify deformation was via Delaunay
triangulation. That is, if three features form a triangle, its changing lengths
and angles -- whose values ImageJ conveniently tabulates in CSV -- describe ice
deformation since triangles unlike quadrilaterals etc are rigid. This method
was used in a recent N-ICE2015 article for the same purpose.

https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016JC012387

Sentinel-1 does not fly over every day by any means. They seem to be using
other sources of imagery in a mix-and-match manner. For example, Sept 25th is a
just an exact copy of Sept 26th in the region shown.

The satellite usage table below from Mosaic's main planning document shows the
options (needs a click to be readable; color legend is screwed up). Naturally,
they have a budge gto buy commercial coverage as needed.

Below are some floe tracking images that tie precise lat/lon positions into the
WorldView visible dates when floes are more intuitively portrayed in clear
weather. The first provides 16 days of daily displacements of the PS Floe based
on their archived mix of radar images. Based on a fairly strong anticyclonic
OsiSaf today, I expect Floe movement to the 'right' overnight.

The Floe is embedded in a larger context that moves as a semi-rigid block;
indeed the whole ice pack is still exhibiting coherence but daily morphological
plasticity as can be seen in the translucent greenish animation from earlier in
Sept. (Ascat arrives as grayscale but two other channels for color can be made
from fourier bandpass filtering that emphasize different scales of contrast
variability.)

Sentinel imagery that Uniq has been posting is far higher quality but involves
handling large initial files in unpopular jp2 format. The 16bit depth provides
much more latitude in contrast adjustment though the gains are not as
phenomenal as with 8bit Ascat. At the end of the day, everything has to be
posted in 8bit x 3.

In the file names, 20191004T064336 parses out to 2019 Oct 04 at UTC time
06:43.36. The two images are then 06:27 - 06:43 apart or 16 minutes short of 48
hours, critical to accurate measurement of floe motion. It's possible to make
'interferometric' color images from just two frames in ImageJ; these have
excellent prospects for displaying deformation over the whole region. As always
we are very dependent on satellite providers for spot-on pixel

The dark blob in the center corresponds to the ice oddity in the first image of
#77. It has stood out for since last autumn out as a relatively white region in
plain Ascat; it is one of the last regions of thick MYI; it barely experienced
TPD last winter.

The third image illustrates tracking of an unrelated floe in Modis Terra. Note
daily or better coverage is needed to define motion as the 'shortcut' shown
does not capture details of multi-day motion.

The fourth image shows the all-weather forward view from the bridge. The dark
triangle is aft. While the floe shapes seems terribly distorted, publications
have used it in the past to measure floe jostling and ice deformation. This
clip is from an earlier voyage. The PS may have it turned on while moored but
is not uploading it to a public archive as far as I know.

I made some headway with buoy tracking. This visualisation may be useful. Still
no projection, just lat/lon. iabp buoy type is IT=Ice tracker, maybe it is on a
snowmobile/helicopter?
edit: 36km in 30min, according to the NOAA calculator https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/
gccalc.shtml, maybe helicopter.

The mosaic multisensor map is improving all the time, from large opaque pointer
and path to semi transparent for both. :) sep28-0ct5 crop. Maybe it will go to
higher resolution as the movement slows down.
I'm not able to match the buoy path above with PS movement so far. Maybe
helicopter flying between boats?? I realise the buoy map needs to be inverted
and flipped.

I thought it was accurate buoy placement, but I think sailwx latitude chart
resolution is struggling this far north. Probably not much value in posting
further.
edit: apologies to the chart creator, the saliwx lat/lon data is only 1 decimal
place.

Off the map for ecmwf windy also. ~50km [DEL:winds:DEL]westerlies forecast
further south on tues.

Smos/Smap has fired up its daily archive at U Bremen again as of Oct 4th,
having ceased production on July 31. This provides an improved thin ice
prediction map relative to plain vanilla Smos (which archives all year despite
accuracy deterioration in summer) by using complementary input from a second
satellite instrument.These are both passive microwave sensors that provide
brightness temperatures at 1.4 GHz.

https://www.the-cryosphere.net/13/675/2019/ Feb 2019 free full Smos/Smap
https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/4/553 Apr 2018 free full Schmidt Kaleschke
https://zenodo.org/record/1631856#.XZr_GOnmBQY Nnov 2018 tech spec Schmidt
Kaleschke

Smos/Smap runs two days behind rather than one day late like Ascat, Smos,
OsiSaf, Amsr2 etc. The cut-off is 0.5 m; all ice thicker than that is shown in
the same palette color (even though some value remains in the 0.5 to 1.0 m
range).

Thus it is most useful right now for Mosaic, near the ice edge during
freeze-up.

The 'pole hole' is larger for Smos/Smap (out to 87º) than for Smos. That's just
as well because that of Smos is almost always ringed with artifacts. Both use
the same thickness palette. Ground resolution is not great but the png's are
released at a much more generous size (1173 x 2170 pxl) than Smos (624 x 757
pxl).

It is generally better for enlargements to be done in-house from the raw
numerical data than done later from postage-stamp products. For example, the
data-obliterating graticule need not be so badly dithered in. Note though that
some netCDF tools like Panoply use linear interpolation whereas bicubic
probably gives better results.

The first image below shows the two are nearly identical on Oct 5th. This means
that Smos was likely quite accurate earlier in Sept contrary to popular
opinion.

In terms of the Polarstern, the <0.5m thin ice of the Laptev anomaly starts
just to their south. This doesn't have the resolution to speak to individual
floes that might be thicker (or practically open water).

The Sep-Oct time series of Smos shows thickening is preceding quite slowly,
with thin ice not clearing the pole hole at 87.5º until Sept 22nd. The
Polarstern is parked at 85º. This means a lot of ice between the ship and Pole
is still quite thin, well less than a meter.

Since one degree of latitude is 111 km, the PS is currently some 555 km south
of the pole. The Great Laptev Bight of thin ice reaches up another 555 km from
the south. Above Banks Island in the Beaufort, the ice has thickened beyond
0.5m for 1839 km. More typically, thicker ice extends out 1100 km from the
pole, the FJI-SV line being another exception like the Laptev. These
asymmetries probably reflect the location of the cold pole vs direction of
proceeding Atlantification.

Measuring the distances ccw from pole to Smos/Smap thin ice edge on 05 Oct 19
using the 15º graticule, the average distance pencils out to 881 km. Adding up
the areas of all the triangle by side-angle-side method using sin(15º) = 0.259
for included pole angle between sectors gives 5,633,429 sq km.

The velocities at which these are expanding would give some idea of when the
deployed Polarstern experiments gain a margin of safety; see #79.

I find the water temp line very satisfying for some reason. It's good to know
the universe is working as intended.

Thank you A-Team and Uniquorn. It's going to be a very exciting winter for all
scientists, including those of us firmly seated in our armchairs.

Safety is a huge issue: a lot of things can go wrong with so many people
deploying so many experiments over a remote and harsh location during the
course of a year. Incredible preparations were required of all who wished to
come aboard, including photojournalists.

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/09/
inside-training-for-mosaic-largest-arctic-expedition-in-history/

Ship & lines please. There are four lifeboats, emergency rafts and a small
launch on the ship, lowered by lines not ropes. When Captain Schwarze says
jump, you jump (even if it's just off the sofa at your WeWork). Or spend the
rest of the cruise cleaning up engine room grease (1st figure, upper right).

Polar bears: German army soldier. Night vision googles. Remote guard tower.
Trip line perimeter. Infrared-triggered game cameras. Blasts from ship's horn.
Flares. Pepper spray. Rifle as last resort. 

On Svalbard, the most common rifle carried is a Mauser 30-06. It has a
confusing 3-way safety with middle position only causing the shell to be
ejected, not fired. That lead to a recent death in a scout camp. A Sabatti 308
or H&K G3 is more probable here. PBs bury themselves in snow drifts (eg lee
side of pressure ridge) leaving only eyes and nose exposed, then snooze until
they can ambush a passerby (as with that young woman in Sv).

The captain has a plan for everything, from fires aboard to abandon ship. The
first high risk period is right now, with the ice too thin and the ice margin
too close. The second is mid-winter when the ice is too thick for support
icebreakers to reach them and at problematic range for helicopters. Fires are a
serious risk througout the cruise.

That recent dive boat accident in California ‘raised awareness’ of the risks of
lithium battery re-charge fires. Passengers had left them charging overnight by
the thousands after the final night dive. I reckon the Polarstern has thousands
of electronic devices aboard, plus all the electrical gear the ship would
normally carry. Almost all ship fires are wiring, engine room or galley;
lithium is new.

We are going to understand the Arctic system a whole lot better thanks to this
fabulous effort. It’s not going to stop the sea ice — and everything contingent
on it — from falling off a cliff the next few years, any more than posting
another expository post here.

What is the shelf life of 2019-20 research, given the rapidity of change? They
are building the Polarstern II as we speak.

https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/polarstern-2.htm

The animation below runs up to Oct 6th. Although passing weather artifacts
cannot be fully removed early on. it clearly shows the ice has not yet settled
down in the area they needed to be in for a year's drift. They knew this going
in but there were no better options.

GFS forecast (from Nullschool) shows a yo-yo swing in temperature in the
vicinity of Polarstern over the next 24 hours or so.

By 12 UTC on 8th Oct, a plume of mild arrives up from Svalbard, yielding
temperatures slightly above 0 C but it is short lived and 12 hours later at 00
UTC on 9th Oct, it forecasts temperatures below -10 C as cold air is advected
across the Pole from the American side towards Russia.

The Polarstern is 'out of the woods' in terms of AMSR2_large sea ice
concentration having solidified in their immediate vicinity to 100% yet the sea
ice is still quite dodgy to their south and the ice edge with open water is not
notably progressing south in the Laptev. The Polarstern is 142 nm (265 km)
north of the nearest open water which surprisingly is still within the reach of
long-reach swells. The water there is still too warm, anomalously so.

Although large format time series (3.215 km resolution) are inconvenient to
work with, they are well-suited to other tasks such as following the formation
of land-fast ice which was once extensive, very thick and perennial but now
almost entirely seasonal.

We may think of ice formation in autumn as a phase change from liquid to solid
but it is better considered as epitaxial crystal growth in a variably
inhomogeneous medium (water + brine + algae). That is, new ice only forms on
the bottom and laterally on the sides of existing older ice.

You will never see a block of new surface ice forming ab initio in Arctic Ocean
open water with AMSR2. (Preconditioned sub-surface, yes, as in fast outreach
coming on now in the Beaufort.) There is too much wind mixing, whereas on the
bottom or sides of existing ice there is minimal stirring plus a locally colder
mileau -- the preexisting seed ice wouldn't be there otherwise.

This is doubly true for internal regions of sub-100% concentration. Thus
color-picking open water invariably yields a plain if wavy ice edge line rather
than a topologically more complex boundary. (We did find an exception a couple
years back of a stable, inexplicable internal polynya.)

The second time series shows the whole Arctic Ocean for the first week of
October. The ice pack as a whole has some internal regions that have not
settled down. It rocks forward and back; the split palette shows an
equalization over the original AMSR2.

For Polarstern protection from ice-rubbishing swells, faster peripheral pack
growth to the south is needed. But is it on the horizon? The blue line (Oct
7th) in the animation doesn't show consistent  progression over the last three
weeks. Mosaic may be documenting the first season of a newer New Arctic.

Well fed bears :)
Following on from A-team's post, polarstern is also slowly drifting south at
the moment which doesn't help their situation. Here is polarview's latest jp2
combined with the jpg which has the graticule overlay. Akademik Fedorov is
brighter today further north. (click for full resolution)

The animation below is ice tracker buoy 300234068129990 showing the last 2 days
drift roughly 2 degrees west of mosaic. North is up, west is left (does my head

    Polarstern drifting south and east

The ice shows no sign of getting its drift act together. Some of these autumn
freeze season time series could be confused with spring melt season. Either
way, great that the PS is out there observing it all.

It's not entirely clear that melt season is over in some parts of the Arctic
Ocean. The Polarstern is at 85ºN so quite a ways poleward (and west) of the
scene below which straddles 80ºN. Mosaic is just now getting set up off-ship;
it will be a week or two before we know if the ice at their floe is thickening
at all and if so, at an expected rate.

The algal bloom may extend north to the PS's location and beyond under <1m ice
once its snow cover is gone, especially under glassy melt pond sites. While
sunlight is minimal now, algae may have captured its heat earlier in summer
just below the surface of the ice (rather than letting it pass down in clear
water to depth). Peak adsorption wavelengths for chlorophyll A are at 465 nm
(blue) and 665 nm (red) whereas green is reflected back up. However algae have
many secondary pigments and also backscatter.

This is one of the three main themes of Mosaic research but not one that likely
to produce near real time outputs for us to illustrate or analyze.

        This search for a suitable floe is ongoing


    This has become a common problem for placing instruments on the Arctic ice.
    It also means measurements are being done under unrepresentative
    conditions.

    Using sampling to ultimately estimate the conditions of the entire Arctic
    via statistical analysis requires representative (usually random) sampling
    but this is no longer possible. The result is likely over estimation of sea
    ice thickness and stability.


Not only that, it’s indicative of a paradigm shift. If ice conditions aren’t
good enough to take proper samples, well, that suggests we’re a lot closer to a
BOE event than some would acknowledge.

Voyages should be done like this yearly, I wish we had this back when there was
actually sea ice and not slush up there.

    <snippage>

It's pretty clear from the temperature data, the extent/area data and the
sensor data from sources like Mosaic that the transition from melt to refreeze
is no where near as distinct as it was prior to the last decade or so.

We are already seeing Arctic breakouts.  Heat intrusions above 75N are
continuing pretty much unabated.  I suspect Mosaic will not show signs of
either significant thickening or serious expansion of the pack into the
peripheral seas for quite some time.

Right. The 1D extent graphs don't capture geolocated nuances.

It turns out to be easy to pattern-match radar images of the Mosaic floe in
early October back to visible images in Worldview in late September (before it
all went dark) because in context, the floe moved as a mildly distorting rigid
body over this time frame.

This enables convenient determination of the floe's provenance, daily
displacements and deformations using the animation feature of WV on clear days
back to 18 Mar 2019 when WV first had enough light.

Note the Mosaic radar archive goes back to Sep 8th and is cloud-free unlike
visible. However its resolution is inconsistent, with a big jump on Oct 7th
after the floe was selected, plus it suffers from a now-irrelevant ship track
overlay. In #74, the floe is tracked back to Sept 21 in radar.

https://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,2906.msg232032.html#msg232032

However PolarView goes back even farther with its Sentinel archive. However
visible and near infrared carry other information such as surface temperature,
insolation history, proximity to algal blooms and wildfire soot deposition.

Because this floe will be so intensively studied over the next year, it is
important to walk it back in time to better understand its 'initial state' in
the Mosaic project.

The last 30 days of sea ice motion suggest that the floe has experienced very
little net tendency towards resuming TransPolar Drift. The floe may have been
in sub-100% concentration (light blue in OsiSaf) in mid-Sept and earlier.

Mosaic buoy data to date can be checked here. There are 16 surface velocity
profilers so far; the downloads clean csv text files with hourly lat/lon to 4
decimals, drift speeds to 3 decimals in m/s, and surface temperature to 1
decimal.

However they don't triangulate the buoys nor give the ensuing Delaunay
deformation over time, for which 16 Excel sheets is ideally suited (and Goog
Earth Pro freeware for the graphic animation).

This is an example of where a forum member could add value to Mosaic by using
the online distance tool that Uniq provided earlier. GPS positions are always
given relative to the WGS84 ellipsoid of revolution rather than the earth
sphere or actual geoid (available as the first 100,000 terms of a spherical
harmonic expansion).

The AWI help desk writes that a more interactive version which will be online
in mid November. [Hallo? Bei uns wäre diese grundlegende Softwareaufgabe
erledigt gewesen, bevor das Schiff gesegelt wäre! Zur Sicherheit muss der
Polarstern nahezu in Echtzeit wissen, wie sich die Belastung im Eis aufbaut,
nw?]

I'm mildly astonished that oceanographers have not set up an online tool that
does this.The triangle math is from the Babylonians 4000 bce, the rest was
published in 1934 by a Russian descendant of a French officer captured during
the Napoleonic invasion of 1812. It is not especially computationally
expensive: the algos are seasoned github deposits for video gamer programmers.

The geometric set-up is very similar to USGS arrays to monitor nrt tectonic
plate collision in Nevada and so earthquake strain in southern California
(though some of that is interferometric as displacements are in microns). This
is the PS's concern as well: sudden opening of leads and rapid formation of
pressure ridges.

I could see it taking me a couple hours to start supplying the PS with nrt
continuum mechanics in its immediate vicinity (but surely they have laptops on
board?). Because the buoy gps is so accurate, this might improve on whatever
deformation overlay they have on PS bow radar, though that would be really rt
instead of hourly.

The issues are kriging up the resolution and assimilating the observed current
system of S1 rifts. The ambient ice has been under extensional tension rather
than compressional.

The explanation for the visualization delay must be that buoy arrays have
rarely been deployed in ice: the Arctic Ocean has long been seriously
under-instrumented. So three cheers for Mosaic's deployments -- this should
have been done every year since Iridium went commercial in 1998.

Found a buoy forensics match to the first deployment question in #40 and chased
down how we got to the words 'buoy' and 'die Boje' (plural Bojen). The English
pages at Mosaic are sometimes delayed a few days.

Nice detective work. Don't we need to see the overall buoy set up before
launching into continuum mechanics? edit: not that I know how to do that ;)
Based on today's multisensor map I think I've located a buoy on or very close
to Polarstern for the last few days. iabp 300234068213470. I'm not sure if this
is value for MB but here is it's drift track since records started.
Quote from: Niall Dollard on October 08, 2019, 12:43:55 AM

    GFS forecast (from Nullschool) shows a yo-yo swing in temperature in the
    vicinity of Polarstern over the next 24 hours or so.

    By 12 UTC on 8th Oct, a plume of mild arrives up from Svalbard, yielding
    temperatures slightly above 0 C but it is short lived and 12 hours later at
    00 UTC on 9th Oct, it forecasts temperatures below -10 C as cold air is
    advected across the Pole from the American side towards Russia.

warmest temp was -2.4C, still quite warm. Of course, it might be sitting in the
hold somewhere so the temps might not be relevant. The drift should be valid
though.

    WV graticule? need final set of buoys? buoys too near the Polarstern?
    Physics of materials?

Spectacular VIIRS above ... but when I went to the link, it had been
over-written by something unrecognizable. That happens all the time at WV as
swath updates roll in. I suppose the bright networks of veins are leads (resp.
thin ice) with warmer water showing through. These might be worth mapping as
lead openings are recurrent weaknesses.

The 43 page explainer for the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite is
here:
https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/134/VNP03_User_Guide_V1.2.pdf

WorldView doesn't do graticules well, 80º is the first latitude out from the
pole with 30º increments on longitudes. Better if NASA provided options for
controlling the OpenStreetMap vector graticule and fixed code so animations
captured it. It's possible but inconvenient to capture the timestamp on a per
swath basis which is critical to synching with other satellites.

While WV does have very accurate mouse-over lat/lon in the corner, those don't
stay tied to a floe after image save or screenshot. Mosaic Multisensor offers a
very nice graticule on their higher resolution images (from Oct 7th on).

For WV, if your save includes long lines intersecting the 80º circle, that
chord length is enough to accurate rescale AMSR2_Large and capture its
graticule as overlay for 75º and 85º plus 1º longitude increments.

/=/=/=/=/=/=

The ship itself is one big fancy drift buoy, not only reporting its GPS but
also whatever parameters those six containers of atmospheric instruments in the
bow are recording. Plus its azimuthal heading which the surface velocity
profilers do not provide.

A rigid body can undergo translations (GPS) and rotations (azimuth changes)
that are not relevant to the brittle failures of concern (opening and closing
of leads, over-rafting of floes, slip-strike shearing and pressure ridges/
keels).

Mosaic actually likes leads because they release ocean heat to the atmosphere
and are important to study for overall energy flows, just not leads that cut
LAN and power lines and strand personnel at field stations.

Taking any three buoys that define a good triangle (not co-linear, no overly
acute angles), the lengths of the three sides and area enclosed do not change
over time in a rigid ice pack. If the area increases, it means leads have
opened under extensional forces; if the area decreases, compressional collapses
have occurred.

If say 70 buoys are deployed, a goodly system of coupled triangles (the
perimeter being the convex hull) emerges for monitoring regional ice
deformation. Here ice brittleness increases non-linearly with colder
temperatures. Since the SVPs record air temperatures at the ice surface and
since the seawater underneath the ice is clamped to -1.7ºC, the temperature
profile through say 2m of ice can be estimated.

Mosaic has two different buoy scales, high resolution local on and around the
chosen floe and more sparsely regional. There aren't enough buoys out there to
do the whole basin. There has been talk of large-scale air drops of passive
devices like radar corner reflectors that would show up as points of light on
Ascat etc. Hasn't happened.

Someone posted a great animation (can't relocate :() of the ice temperature
profile behavior under an upper sinusoidal (seasonal) boundary conditions, plus
an explicit solution of the governing heat equation. Thus if the a curve is
fitted to the buoy's hourly temperatures, each term in its fourier expansion
will have an exact solution -- and these are additive solutions.

However real ice has many issues such as surface snow and its complex aging
status, frozen-in air bubbles, variable salinity inclusions, brine pockets,
crystal dislocations, adherent algae and copepods etc etc meaning that the heat
conductivity parameter isn't constant or known. So it is easier just to freeze
in a string of thermistors below the buoy.

/=/=/=/=/=/=

We can do a lot better than that cramped meereisportal visual just with a
drag-n-drop of all the buoy lat/lon columns onto google earth pro. The
advantage of GEP is the liquid rescaling to any zoom, a free parameter for
temperature or thickness and mouse-over popups; the disadvantage is there does
not seem to be a digitized daily ice edge line around. However there is a way
of auto-generating that from say the AMSR2 blue edge.

GEP barely pauses loading a kml file with 250,000 lat/lon waypoints. That would
be 30 buoys reporting hourly for a year. Hourly is a bit much given slow drift
speeds but it is great for dynamic triangles. There is very little overhead to
drawing lines between buoy pairs with the same timestamp.

/=/=/=/=/=/=

The AMSR2 images below compare the ice edges on the Siberian side south of the
Polarstern on Oct 10th for 2013-2019 (the 2012 is not provided by the UHH
archive). The large format 3.125 km does notably better on growing landfast
ice. This narrow strip is difficult to image because of the irregular coastline
can occupy part of rectangular gridded pixels.

Clearly autumn 2019 is off to a very slow start; the magenta overlay line on
earlier years shows how much open water is still left in the Laptev, the star
at bottom shows the Polarstern location. I don't expect the 500 km reach of
open water to freeze over any time soon because shallow shelf water been
increasingly affected by Atlantification. The Laptev had frozen over completely
in 2012-13 by the first of the year.

Animations of buoys drift speed attached, code on my github, it should be
possible to take a set of buoys and calculate their movements respective of
each other.. interesting idea

there's accelometer data in the buoy data as well, I assume this can be related
to wave height or ice bits bumping into each other?

Also if anyone has good data files for ice concentration/movements please let
me know. I saw AMSR2 has hdf files but they're a bit of a pain, preferably
something with coordinates.

Quick and easy way to do that on a massive scale -- # of buoys and # of times
-- is a database mail merging into kml template (keyhole markup language, human
readable text like html), let Google Earth do the scalable display over a
bathymetry background plus calculate all the distances and polygonal areas for
you to very high WGS84 accuracy and then load it up on a web browser so clients
don't need GE installed.

Just look at the attached txt file for the triangle ... it's so easy, it's so
easy to parse it out and drop into their display engine.

The SVP buoy 2019P152_300234068218450_proc.csv weighs in at just 16 kb for 299
lines. The three buoy triangle, 1 kb. So not talking serious text wrangling
here with a few dozen buoys for a year; in SV days our group was knocking out
16 terabyte based scientific displays, trillions of buoys.

Update: the differencing of successive days of AMSR2_large is an effective way
of visualizing closure of the open gap between the Polarstern and the Siberian
shoreline: central ice pack edge growth meets growing landfast ice. Growth of
that is just now kicking in.

I was just barely able to scale down mosaic.multisensor to overlay the
Polarstern drift path on the 3.125 km resolution AMSR2; this require downsizing
the radar original to 0.45% to get the path scaled (no sign of TPD yet).

There are a lot of ways to slice and dice the buoy data, the first substantial
nrt data set we’ve had to work with, other than satellite products, since the
ice penetrating radar archive for Greenland. In past years, 0-1 buoys have been
reporting, often defectively, in the entire Arctic Ocean whereas now we have a
large active coupled buoy array in the vicinity of the Polarstern..

The data archiving is still a bit rough, for example the second set of buoys
below don’t measure snow depth or ice thickness as their meereisportal table
indicates. However provisional graphs of temperature and speed are provided as
a convenience and updated daily.

The Polarstern itself behaves as a giant buoy since being stably moored on Oct
4th. No hourly database for it accompanies the others. The radar image archive
shifted to high resolution on Oct 7th. The pixel dimensions shifted
inexplicably from 3500 x 4304 to 3498 x 4302 between the 7th and 9th, causing
stacking issues. (Inexplicable because the crop tool has a fixed-size checkbox
in all known image software.) The timestamps are all 0500 UTC; lat/lon of the
Polarstern are not provided in the extensive legend.

The Sentinel images have different pixel offsets each day. Lagrangian
coordinates (co-moving with ship) are being used; they cause havoc with the
graticule and drift course overlay. It's more common on satellite series to use
fixed eulerian coordinates to illustrate floe and lead dynamic development.

https://data.meereisportal.de/download/buoys/photos/2019P191_deployment.pdf

The first set of RSAQUA-type SVP buoys was deployed by Chinese scientists.
These measure GPS position every hour along with temperature. From lat/lon they
derived displacements (not shown) by an unknown equation (vincenty?
haversine?), from which speeds were determined hourly. These buoys do not carry
a wave heave accelerometer. Tides in the open Arctic are too low and slow to
give a reading.

I checked into measurement error. One degree difference in latitude on the WGS
ellipsoid is 111,111 meters. The GPS is reported to 1 part in 10,000, meaning
85.1234º can barely be distinguished for 85.1235º. Thus the positional
uncertainty is 11.1 meters which is inadequate for a cruise missile but
plausible this far north.

In calculating items like the changing sides and angles of a delaunay
triangulation array, no purpose is served by exceeding the accuracy of the
data.

It appears the buoys do not track azimuth. That is, unlike a ship, there is no
natural axis unless the floe itself is stably asymmetric. Rotation of the floe
in which the buoy is frozen is thus difficult to disentangle from translation.

We have measured large floes spinning around and around in the Beaufort arm
eddies in previous autumns. In the vicinity of the Polarstern, the ice is
mainly moving en bloc. The arm is forming nor this month and will likely extend
up the Alaskan coast to the Chukchi before turning north. The ice will not move
in a gyre, it hasn't for over a decade.

A column for changing bearing angle can be added using batch online tools (or
spreadsheet formula). I did this for 2019P152 using positions 24, 48 and 72
hours apart; to the extent calculated bearings change more than the track
implies, the floe has rotated. Bearing, heading and course are a source of
perpetual confusion but see:

https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html

There is no column for changes in drift speed (acceleration) but that is
implicit as the slope of the tangent line to the speed graph (below). The one I
looked at 2019 has a puzzling periodicity. Obviously if other 11 buoys don’t
follow in parallel, they are diverging/converging and the ice in between is
deforming.

2019P152
2019P155
2019P156

D Watkins, a grad student at Oregon State who studies ‘Arctic lower
tropospheric temperature inversions in the CESM large ensemble’ deployed a
second set of nine buoys (brand not provided) from the helicopter of the
Akademik Federov.

2019P188  2019P196
2019P190  2019P198
2019P191  2019P200
2019P192  2019P203  2019P206

These buoys apparently do have an onboard accelerometer, though the column
heading is "accelometer_variance ()" with units omitted but values ranging from
5 to 15. It’s not clear why the buoy should expect any waves in the next 8
months. I tracked down an explanation of sorts from NDBC not specific to this
particular buoy:

Quote

    How are spectral wave data derived from buoy motion measurements?
    https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/wave.shtml

    NDBC-reported wave measurements are not directly measured by sensors on
    board the buoys. Instead, the accelerometers or inclinometers on board the
    buoys measure the heave acceleration or the vertical displacement of the
    buoy hull during the wave acquisition time. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
    is applied to the data by the processor on board the buoy to transform the
    data from the temporal domain into the frequency domain. Note that the raw
    acceleration or displacement measurements are not transmitted shore-side.
    Response amplitude operator (RAO) processing is then performed on the
    transformed data to account for both hull and electronic noise. It is from
    this transformation that non-directional spectral wave measurements (i.e.,
    wave energies with their associated frequencies) are derived. Along with
    the spectral energies, measurements such as significant wave height
    (WVHGT), average wave period (AVGPD), and dominant period (DOMPD) are also
    derived from the transformation.

I see science heroic but on the quiet side. But well OK.

Mosaic is posting the daily location radar in quasi-lagrangian coordinates,
with the point position of the Polarstern and the North Pole determining the
moving axis. In normal ship-based lagrangian coordinates, the bow-stern center
line and main mast would determine the coordinate system (alternately some
asymmetry axis on the floe to which the Polarstern is afixed). The difference
is in how rotation is represented.

We are more used to eulerian coordinates in satellite archives where the
graticule stays fixed. We went through this all before in the time of Ptolemy
and Galilleo.

Whoever painted on the red lines and circle, over-writing the value of the most
important pixels, seems not have centered them accurately on the ship which
shows clearly as a bright white dot (all that metal reflecting Sentinel's beam
back). Perhaps those circles reference a valid timestamp but one different from
the S1 which would appear in its file name had it been correctly cited.

At any rate, I adjusted the six dates for which for which they archived S1 at
higher resolution, so from Oct 7th to Oct 12th so far. As noted above, some of
these are either mis-cropped or slightly rescaled from the others. The
Polarstern tied on Oct 4th but those dates are missing (4-6 Oct).

We need to go back to the original files and do this over, right. I am not sure
though that all of them are S1 as it does not seem that polarview carries them
all at the needed resolution. If so that would mean a tedious navigation deep
through the ESA server.

At any rate, despite the visual competition from the crazy graticule and red
paint, it was possible to re-register six days of imagery. The four gifs below
present the data at four levels of zoom. A lot could be said about leads
opening and closing, scene deformation, rotation of the PS floe and so on.
These run at 150 ms per frame; download and view frame by frame. I also
prepared a single concatenate mp4 that has a better controller but am out of
attachments here.

New snow buoy deployed by Mosaic on Oct 11th. These seem to work by taking four
sonar measurements from above, with calibration of actual snow at time of
deployment. The sonar footprint is about 10 sq meters ... necessary because the
snow pack is quite variable and subject to drift accumulations (or bare ice
spots).

Again, the manufacturer of the device are not provided; very likely the listed
contact M Hoppmann of AWI can provide details. However the device is probably
very similar to snow buoy 2014S12, deployed during Polarstern cruise PS82
though that one also measure internal ice temperature. Again, it is not the ice
mass balance buoy that meereisportal keeps referencing (crossed out below).

https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.875328

The database fields here can be readily integrated with the other 16 sea ice
drift buoys in the growing array and its track displayed in GEP as before.
Since all the buoys so far are reporting hourly on the hour, that can be used
as the indexed field for a single composite flatfile db with just the essential
lat,lon column + one additional parameter of choice.

This will allow individual tracks of the entire 17-buoy array to be displayed
over bathymetry and coastline with either Voronoi or Delauney triangulation,
with easy updating since the year is just getting started. This is just a paste
into a kml template, not rocketry science.

Here are those additional floe tracking time series mention a couple of posts
back. The first concatenates four levels of zoom into a movie with frame
controller; the second presents 07-12 Oct 2019 data in eulerian coordinates
that are better if overlays with other satellites are planned.

Here I used the .avi export option out of ImageJ and converted to mp4 with the
free online tool:
https://cloudconvert.com/avi-to-mp4

The concept of a massively coupled buoy array is new and not fully implemented
at meereisportal. The buoys are already experiencing glitches -- whether at the
level of sensors, Iridium transmission or IT processing station at AWI I
couldn't say -- that result in missing timestamps, eight in a row (4 hrs) for
P152 and one for P188 (below).

These data gaps are not indicated by NaN or dashes as they should be; the csv
files just skip the lines with no indication. Consequently, each person using
the files has to run a separate detector for them (a new column subtracting
consecutive time stamps sorted for anomalies).

The gaps then need to be filled in, most easily by linear interpolation from
the lines above and below. If the csv isn't repaired, graphic representation of
the buoy will be misleading and worse, be out of temporal synch forever more
with locations of the other 16 buoys.

Some of buoys are reporting hourly, others twice hourly. If this seems
excessive, it can be reduced to every 4, 8, 12, 24 hours by windowing with an
appropriate fill-down averaging column followed by remainder (modular)
arithmetic in the spreadsheet that consolidates all the individual buoy
reports.

This master spreadsheet has one column for common time, lon and lat columns for
track plotting, a column for displacement and a free column depending on what
the particular buoy measures (air temp, snow depth etc). So far I have only put
4 of the 17 into a master. It starts 04 Oct 19 when the Polarstern first
moored.

Then there is the matter of updating, say adding incoming data once a week.
It's probably better to start from scratch rather than just appending because
some of the data gaps might have been repaired and new buoys might have been
deployed.

Meereisportal has not implemented the Polarstern itself as a buoy. While it is
surely collected, I don't where that location data is posted in a compatible
format.

Since the buoys are quite co-localized now, there may be grid regularization
advantages in setting up companion files for virtual buoys (stable features on
ice radar). This could only be done once a day, not hourly, and involves manual
observation and recording.

The initial locations at deployment of the 17 buoys (at various dates) are
shown in a broader context in the GE screenshot (orange polygon). The magenta
and green circles show the largest possible free rotations of the ice pack
without coming up against fixed land; green is restricted by the de Longa
islands. The centers, called the poles of inaccessibility have been determined
very accurately in recent papers.

The first image breaks the latest radar image of the Polarstern's route into
daily segments by using successively earlier dates (which have to be moved to
align under their co-moving frame reporting).
Once again, we see that net travel over a week is far too long to resolve
actual distance drifted by a factor of 3x here.

A junior scientist onboard twittered their initial mooring position in decimal
minutes (!) as "84º04.582' 134º25.769' at 9:30 pm Friday boat time (!!)". I
could not confirm that ship time used is UTC but would hope so. The PS may know
its GPS position better than the buoys: 84.07637 134.42948 which suggests 1.1 m
accuracy but that is not entirely clear.

ftp://ftpsrv2.awi.de/sea_ice/mosaic/jpg/large/
mosaic_multisensor_map_2019-10-13_hr_NoOverlay.jpg

If the adjacent ice pack were moving as a rigid non-deforming block, the buoys
would all change speeds in concert. They don't quite (slide show, 4 PRIC
buoys).

Esther Horvath has been taking some great photos from the PS. The ice thickness
looks barely able to support some of the heavy gear that has to be set up on
the ice, such as the 'Ocean City' electric hub.

Update on the position of the Polarstern and the ice immediately around it,
eight days to 14 Oct 2019. The selected floe continues to drift the wrong way
(south towards Siberia). The icepack edge has scarcely advanced towards Russia
or Alaska in recent days though ii is almost all thickened beyond the 0.5m
sensor cutoff on SMOS.

The floe has not rotated so far despite a multi-day ice cyclone sweeping up
from Banks Island (green over-tint, lower left OsiSaf). 

Although ice movement is strictly wind-driven (subject to boundary conditions
and internal cohesion), it rarely corresponds to anything seen in GFS
near-surface winds at nullschool. We lost daily coverage of ECMWF in the forked
windy.com code when Arctic view was killed for lack of sufficient clicks. 

I sincerely doubt that GFS will assimilate data from Mosaic buoys and
Polarstern any time soon though that would improve its initializations and
ever-changing near-term forecasts.

Only spotty information has been released to date about the selected floe's ice
thickness, snow cover, lead/ridge/keel structure and historic provenance
despite many EMBird transects flown. S1 radar shows north and south regions of
the floe as quite dark (poor return of impinging radar beam) with a better
reflecting (whiter) speckled east-west stripe.

This can tentatively be interpreted in terms of near-surface dielectric: dark
areas are older ice that are farther along in extruding brine pockets that form
during freezing, lighter areas are newer, speckled surface arise from fusion of
two floes via freeze-over of intervening sea water and collisional compression
into ridges and jumbles. The ice is so thin though that salt left by
over-washing waves sometime in the past has affected the surface.

If so, the Polarstern is moored to the weakest part of the floe. However I
don't expect shearing here because a number of old leads can be seen opening
and closing in the near vicinity; these will accommodate regional ice strain.

The fourth image, taken from Uniq at #82, shows the Polarstern's floe without
all the disruptive overlays. I made some very slight improvements in image
quality by linear contrast spreading, weak adaptive contrast enhancement and
unsharp mask. Two off-the-shelf indexed color palettes provide a start on ice
classification based on radar reflectance (residual near-surface polarity).

It is possible, with a big handful of €€€s, to order up much higher resolution
SAR imagery of the floe. Possibly that new company would do it gratis for the
press. It's too late to order visible as the cloud-free sunlit window closed
Sept 24th.

What is causing these wild swings in overall light/dark radar contrast in
successive days at the same spot? Maybe S1A vs S1B or ascending vs descending
orbits. Hard to say, they don't provide image identifying numbers.

The buoy data is like that too, referenced with shipboard chatter. Buoys are
required to have a unique IMEI to transmit wireless data; that identifier is
their real name. The IMEI then is tied 1:1 with 2019P155 etc so informally P155
(as other years are not involved).

An update on the meerisportal buoys on macid's post upthread, tinkering with
the code a little enables us to zoom in on the 12 buoys closest to the
polarstern location. Still not sure which is the most flexible buoy analysis
tool.

Very nice! Most excellent progress on a viable multi-buoy display. It maps
polar coordinates to cartesian, similar to mapping the earth ellipsoid to a
mercator cylinder rolled out to a flat tangent plane. This will work quite well
as long as the buoys are clustered near each other. As the year goes on, they
will disperse all over the Eurasian AO and distortion will increase
unacceptably.

I looked at putting another nice ice graphic by E Horvath of the Polarstern
parked at its floe underneath the sprites ... so-so outcome to date.

Buoy repositories are popping up all over, which is great for data
availability. These are being structured as relational databases rather than
flat-file; for example Meereisportal is putting auxillary flatfile dbs in
mouse-over notes.

Any relational db can be accommodated in a flatfile like excel. However that is
very inefficient and a great many cells will be empty. Relational db are
constructed relative to a master key (buoy indexing file) which in this case is
the mandatory IMEI mobile device number.

That is the counterpart to the latin binomial of a plant, eg Dryas octopetala.
There, just like with the buoys, divergent common names are used mountain
avens, eightpetal mountain-avens, white dryas, and white dryad. (And that's
just english.)

What I’ve seen so far is not going to scale for coordinated analysis of say six
dozen buoys posting 5-6 columns of data 48 times a day over a year (7,568,640
cells).

In my view, a front end is needed that allows the data set to be sensibly
queried. For example, someone might want only buoy data over a specific time
frame, from only buoys within a specified initial radius of the Polarstern that
have both air temperature column and snow thickness with no more than 2% NaN
gaps.

For this, a natural choice would be (open source, highly developed, widely
used) MySQL rather than proprietary software or ad hoc code. While this could/
should have been up and running using proxy data given eight years of Mosaic
planning, it wasn’t. These sites are not going to restructure mid-season but
rather dig themselves in deeper.

    installation?

Do we have lat/lon for them? They may not be buoys but rather passive metal
containers/reflectors like the 'Ocean City' transformer. Alternatively, they
could be rfi (radio frequency interference) from active emitters that sometimes
plague Smos and AMSR2 (despite reserved frequencies).

In the 122-page planning document, it's noted that all electrnic devices on
board must be a signature registered with the ship because with 300 tons of
equipment, some rfi is only to be expected initially. Email to 50 kb text is
allowed to anyone appropriate on the ship; no hefty graphics.

@zlabe is posting very useful negative NAO anomaly graphics bimonthly which are
something Mosaic needs to keep an eye on if they want transpolar drift. Not
that there's any way to flip negative to positive. I've attached the daily
pattern since mid-March.

Today's polarview image, this time showing the jpg with graticule (no contrast
change),
The longitude lines are 132 and 128E
Maybe too much movement from yesterday in the 3rd reflection for a tethered
object.
edit: obviously it was AF that moved, see gif below, click to run, click all
images for full resolution.
more edit:
 jp2 saved as png with linear contrast and a smaller crop jp2@200% bicubic>png

    16-bit p2 saved as png with linear contrast and the same jp2>png default
    (honest

Wie, bitte? On these large 16 bit jp2 that open as 16 bit in current versions
of Gimp but not ImageJ, the contrast and resizing tools will work for initial
steps at the 16 bit level. This provides a huge advance in opportunities over
8-bit because the pixel value histogram, which is initially a cookie-cutter
gaussian distribution, doesn't bin up as contrast tools operate, introducing
visually apparent round-off errors. (The 16-bit also has to round calcs but the
error is out in weedy decimals and is discarded later.)

Here the jp2 might open as color but it is really just one-channel grayscale,
like an Ascat gif. Those i put into 8-bit gray, then bump in 16-bit and
sometimes 32-bit before running re-sizing and contrast tools. However it's
ultimately necessary to drop back down to 8-bit when pasting back and forth
with Gimp or posting to forum.

We very much want to get the best possible radar image of the floe and
surrounding area, optimally enlarged 2-3x with bicubic while still in 16-bit,
because yesterday the Helmholz blog posted two very important high resolution
images of floes made with via sled and helicopter instruments.

The Sentinel images come as 'Greenland down' so need a 180º rotation to get
north up to match. This is a integer matrix transform which does not recompute
splines and so has zero effect on resolution at any bit depth.

The Polarstern also has access to TerraSAR-X (DLR) which is one of these crazy
public-private partnerships where the public pays once but pays again to see.
Canada likes this too; only oil and mining companies can afford the imagery.

Just asking for a friend: Do CA and DE pay for all the multi-billions of
satellite freebies that NASA puts online? Do they pay for all the
multi-billions of medical genome data the US gives away? Do they pay for use of
GFS; do we pay for ECMWF built off our satellites?

One of the prime objectives of Mosaic -- since a ship cannot always be out
there -- is to improve interpretation of daily satellite imagery. Here we have
mildly dated RGB and VIIRS band 31 images of the selected floe (ausgewählten
Scholle) but daily tag-along Sentinel radar for the coming twelve months.

The Mosaic time posted a very interesting graphic of GEM-2 EM ice thickness
over a high resolution radar of a floe they investigated early on but didn't
choose. The date, scene ID number and grid scale aren't provided nor is the
latitude (~85º?) though it lies along 137ºE. Again, better to provide layers so
people can see what is buried under the opaque swath lines.

https://blogs.helmholtz.de/polarstern/en/2019/10/mapping-floes
On board 10 Oct 2019 by Stefan Hendricks and team:

Quote

    …  to measure each floe’s thickness we used the Polarstern sled's built-in
    electromagnetic ice-thickness sensor. By combining our findings onsite with
    the radar images from the satellites, we arrived at an overview of the ice
    situation in the region. Lighter areas on radar are associated with rougher
    surfaces characteristic of thicker ice; darker radar returns with thinner
    smoother ice.

    The other tool is an airborne laser scanner (ALS) which can detect
    fine-scale changes in surface height below the helicopter. The sensor has a
    300 m swath. The floe is ~2500 x 3500 sq meters.

    What we found: the vast majority of the floes surveyed consisted of very
    thin (30 – 70 cm) sea ice and had meltwater ponds (Schmelztümpeln) that had
    since frozen over, a clear indicator of intensive melting in the summer, on
    much of their surface area. Floes of this type can easily break apart or be
    pushed together, which makes long-term, continuous monitoring and measuring
    work highly problematic.

    Indeed, in the past few days, heavy winds have produced a number of cracks
    in the ice of our floe, as a result of which our map is no longer entirely
    accurate. It’s precisely events like this one that we plan to spend the
    next year investigating. [[paraphrased]]

The first map shows the Polarstern moored on its starboard side to the floe.
The bow is used as center of a polar coordinate graticule and extends out as
the 0 of 12 angles set out CCW like wristwatch hours. Latitude circles are set
out every 250 m out to about 3 km. North is not indicated but apparently
straight up; magnetic north is really problematic at these latitudes given
rapid wandering of that pole and erratic drift of the floe.

The color scheme is qualitative: light blue for thin ice, dark blue for thicker
and white for elevated ridges and standing ice blocks. Snow depth is not shown.
No color scale is provided. This is odd because the ALS is a precision laser.
It's not clear whether ALS data has been combined with the thickness sled or is
just being used as a freeboard detector.

We'll be referring to this camp map and ice thickness a lot: the direct link to
the 3112 x 3691 image is below. I've scaled it down by 3/8 for the forum (to
1140 x 1400, needs click to see) and added a small Sentinel floe scene (to be
replace soon by a Uniq jp2.)

Whoa ... 600 of them acquiring all this data, a handful of people here trying
to assimilate it?

Eight new buoys. These are CTD types: instrumented wires hanging down holes
drilled in the ice to 100 m to record temperature, salinity, conductivity, and
water pressure at four depths (rather than continuously like a profiler
motoring sensors up and down a wire). Not much on surface except air
temperature and nrt GPS. These are not ice mass balance profilers as they do
not measure thickness or temperature of the ice.

These were basically deployed along 85ºN at various longitudes 131-137ºE so
make for a very good set of differential drift detectors. We are up to 25 new
buoys with GPS plus the PS.

This is really short-sighted of Mosaic not to name these systematically (who
thought of 1,2,...8?) Hopefully Meereisportal will correct it but so far they
have not. They should be categorized as Ice Beacons, that is 2019B01 etc.The
buoys do have IMEI identifiers. No one is listed as contact. They were deployed
from 07-11 Oct 19 on but data first surfaced on Oct 15th.

The slow slide show below shows the results these buoys collected so far.

The right hand side shows a crop of the left hand legend corner of all the
mosaic multisensor maps. It shows the ship lat/lon position times are quite
erratic relative to (not-provided) radar timestamps. This may explain why the
red overlay circles are such a clumsy fit to the actual white pixels of the
ship -- different times. It's not clear whether the wavy intermediate
transparent red track between my green squares (the actual ship displacement on
the day stated) follows actual hourly ship GPS waypoints or is just creatively
hand-drawn.

The final graphic illustrates the latest meteorology collected on the
Polarstern, something that it has been doing for the last 25 years. This data
is sent in immediately to be assimilated for ECMWF forecast initialization (and
later re-analysis).

The wind angle graphic is not so easy to read but they provide that digitally
as well. Mosaic has a plan for 5-day ice motion prediction (SPIDX?) so real
near-surface data will be important to that.

Meereisportal just uploaded a whole new batch of floes while I was typing up
the post above. There are now 35 deployed.They are playing catch-up, these new
ones were set out some time ago.

Their table is quite good, though it could use a couple of columns for latest
positions as well as sort options. However the html is clean and it drops right
into excel. The attached csv file shows the buoys sorted by name, northernmost
latitude of deployment, and reverse chronological deployment order. Be good to
add the IMEI and whatever UW buoy center has about them, 2nd link.

They do encourage questions, the Helmholtz blog allows replies, the twitter
sites have threads and so on. Below I started on social media translations and

Plenty to do tomorrow then. Updated my previous post using gimp 2.10.12. Will

Below I update the daily segments of Polarstern drift to 16 Oct 2019, made an
overlay of the drift track on Smos of the same date (where it barely shows,
even somewhat exaggerated), and took your best S1B of Oct 6th above and
enhanced/enlarged it to fit over the Ice Camp which the S1 radar lacks the
resolution to do really. The radar needs a 180º rotation to fit the ship's
convention.

That is, the Ice Camp original is posted 975 pixels for 1000 m (did they intend
1:1?) whereas the
recent mosaic multisensor maps have 3797 pixels for 1º of latitude (111.111 km)
which is 29.3 pixels per meter. Thus the Ice Camp has a better scale by 30:1

Nonetheless, the fit is quite informative in terms of helping to interpret
radar over the wider scene. I am still of the view that the thicker ice in the
Mosaic floe is a mashup of two thinner floes, either collision or over-riding.
It is FYI that has barely graduated to SYI. The floes all around it are 70-90
cm. The year of Ascat rules out an MYI drifting into this area.

We did find the floe on Worldview for a few days in late Sept (somewhere
above). At its best resolution, 9 pixels per 1000 m, even less can be expected
for the overlay. Hopefully the Polarstern took visible imagery in early
October.

Low sun angle can be extremely effective showing quantitative topographic
relief as we've seen at Jakobshavn. If not, they might scan the Polarstern's
very powerful searchlights across the scene while a helicopter records from
above.

For people wishing to do the daily (weekly?) download of all the Mosaic buoys,
simply use a web browser utility that can open a list of urls and save image
contents. I obtained this by drilling into the open file system at
meereisportal and copying/sorting the buoy directory. The url shown is an
example; add the front part to the buoy name + IMEI list. Note 2019S88 is
listed but its location isn't relevant.

The timestamp, lat, lon, speed columns are invariably the first four so if that
is all you want to plot drifts, there may be some simple way of opening all the
downloads in excel as a stack and deleting all the rest. It would be better if
the buoys were in reverse-chron order as that would synch the rows of buoys
that had different deployment dates. Still, some are on the hour, others on the
half hour, skipped times not indicated with empty rows.

Note the confusion presented by 2019O1-O8. These have a zero and a capital 'O'
for buoy type. (However Meereis does not have an explanation for this category
in its pop-up key.

 Looks like it.
Here showing the Sbuoys drift and air temperature. Will have to work out how to
show 'distance to surface' 1-4 later.
Anomalous movement on the last buoy at the end. Have to work out labelling
also.

You and A-Team are doing an amazing job visualizing this stuff. Thanks so much
for that.

I hope the folks on the Polarstern follow your work. Maybe get ideas from you?
Maybe give us additional data to work on?

One can dream, right? ;)

Grrr... reconciling Meereisportal with UW's IADB global buoy database turns up
[DEL:73:DEL] 69 buoys associated with Mosaic. They are all in the 85/136º
neighborhood and still actively reporting October 15-17 (except for 2019P16
which last reported on the 11th).

IADB does not allow collection of urls to the data directory; the links on
their site are fast but lead to some mumbo jumbo and an onClick .dat file (same
as .csv)
 
http://iabp.apl.washington.edu/maps_daily_table.html
<a href="#BumBuoys" onClick="popData(300234010077180);"

The confusion presented by 2019O1-O8: these are not just badly numbered 1-8;
they have a zero and a badly chosen capital 'O' for buoy type. However Meereis
does not have an explanation for this buoy type in their pop-up key. IADP calls
them CTD type which fits their data content.

Tides in the middle of the ocean go up and down, merely 30-50 cm at the
locations considered. GPS measures sideways. Tidal currents go sideways but
mostly near islands or mainland.

Meanwhile inertial waves (wind-induced, coriolis restoring force) have a 12 hr
period whereas tides are more like 12:50. (One of the authors below was my
roommate in grad school!). There could also be periodic systemic errors having
to do with time of day and the buoys position relative to the GPS satellite
constellation

An extensional crack was reported yesterday out as the meteorological tower was
being installed in Met City. The fissure has since widened to 5 cm; the length
has not been reported. Np equipment has been lost or damaged.

No map has been provided showing position of the crack relative to the radar
image, conceptual camp layout or high resolution Ice Camp lidar map.

Met City was not planned to be located straight out (ie perpendicular) from the
ship but rather at 45º CCW. This would put it at about 2hr on the Ice Camp map
above, in or below the Fortress Area.

We need more information before the crack can be related to regional ice pack
motion but so far no shearing has been seen, the floe has experienced an
extensional failure, probably because "it couldn't keep up" with the rest of
the regional ice pack as it moved zonally towards the islands of SZ under the
influence of persistent easterly winds.

Since the freeboard is only four inches or so, someone could stick their hand
in the crack and touch sea water. However it will freeze very rapidly
sandwiched between two slabs of cold ice, air temperatures being irrelevant.
(This happens in mountaineering when someone falls into a crevasse and is why
two rope teams are imperative.)

What caused the crack?

(1) Ship photos show a full moon. That will bring out the tidal conspiracists
in force. How this could come into play 500 km from land in 4000 m water at
extreme polar latitude needs a quantitative exposition, in particular
prediction of the crack's orientation of the crack which I expect to be more or
less perpendicular to wind direction.

(2) What happens out there is floes differ greatly (ridges, edges) in the
extent to which the wind can take a hold (friction). This results in a very
uneven tensile stress that is not offset yet by compression of the ice pack
against land. Pushing on nearby water that envelopes the periphery -- or even
on sub-100% concentration ice -- is like pushing on a string. These forces are
maybe 3-4 orders of magnitude more significant than tidal.

(3) The ship itself induced the crack. It is in effect a very tall pressure
ridge that catches a lot of wind. It created a long wide lead of broken ice
coming in -- the ship has a beam of 27 m.

The 'gale force' winds reported could have torqued the ship against the ice
pack, leveraging crack formation. When the Akademic Fedorov was along side,
considerable collateral impacts were seen in the adjacent still-fragile ice.

Planning documents show Mosaic is very well aware of "observer effect" issues
presented by the ship itself, resupply vessels, and bunker fuel exhaust and has
mitigation plans for all of them. Events like pressure ridge and lead formation
are not at all unusual -- and studying them in situ is one of the reasons the
PS is out there.

(4) Waves and strong swells developing over a long reach can indeed penetrate
hundreds of kms into an ice pack and be highly disruptive. However that can be
ruled out in this instance, even though the Polarstern did report a day or two
of gales.

(5) Ocean currents can be ruled out: there are no surface here, other than what
is induced by keels of ice blown by the wind. Even if independent near-surface
currents did exist, they would just carry floes along rather than stress them.
If at an angle to wind stress, floes would be sheared.

The twitter sites and blogs have no had spontaneous coverage to date; they are
typically multiple days behind events and are largely communication promotions
pitched at major media or education.

This crack was accompanied by a major oddity in the mosaic_multisensor daily
drift which shows the Polarstern as having left the floe. However it appears
that they were not able to obtain a fresh Sentinel image and simply re-used the
one from yesterday (see identity in comparison below).

The Polarstern has not left because of the crack incident and is still moored
to the floe which regionally is drifting up against Severnaya Zemlya.

    Why can't we the funding public get access to terraSAR imagery?

It is being used quite a bit now at Neumayer Station in Antarctica. Provides
great imagery ... though we are looking for ultra-high resolution at one spot
in the Arctic Ocean; orbital coverage may have to be requested.

I found that image on the blog of R Moore, who is part of the @MOSAiCArctic
field school. It did not enlarge on a click and but does  not represent the
full quality available. It is 1024 x 795 and said copyrighted, though under
non-commercial Fair Use Doctrine, it can be freely distributed especially if
trivial changes like 180º inversion are made (new art).

The blog posting predated selection of the floe. She did not know/say that this
was The Floe, that is my interpretation. As usual, no identification numbers
were provided with the image so we wouldn't know what to ask for. It is better
to embed ID numbers in the image or include them in the file name so they can't
get separated (as in EXIF metadata).

Exif direct-to-url yielded:

Pixels Per Unit X: 2835
Pixels Per Unit Y: 2835
Pixel Units: Meters
Modify Date: 2019:10:15 01

Here that was ominously satImage_smallsize.png which could mean cropped or
dumbed down in resolution or both. Sounds like it was resized down from an
original 2835 x 2835 but by whom? The floe is about 100 pixels high as
downloaded; in real life it is ~3500 m in this dimension. The exif meters/pxl
then makes no sense.

I did not get anywhere walking back the directory to a folder that might
contain a full size version, just 403's forbidden. Not sure why it is hosted at
CIRES Colorado when Moore is a grad student in applied math at Utah, on the AF
for six weeks. At any rate, I wrote away for the original file.

That is a typical shearing pattern seen in brittle material failures. It
extends some 20 multiples of the floe's width in the png posted above which is
~50 km. There is some hint that it has forked around the (thicker) selected
floe. Today was a two-fer on S1B: the PS floe was caught at two times an hour
and 38 minutes apart (below, green dot is Polarstern).

We need to map the opening and closing of leads over the last month, easy given
a co-registered archive. Both Gimp and ImageJ are loaded with edge detectors,
which is run on your image below.

Leads can open and close up overnight to the point of unrecognizability.
Pressure ridges ... not sure they can be seen. Might be lighter lineations due
to roughness on the scale of Sentinel-1AB which operate at 5.404 gigahertz,
meaning surface roughness at the order of the 5.5 cm wavelength.

Incredibly close call with those big leads opening but they could have relieved
a lot of regional ice stress. They also could have sent a lot of
difficult-to-replace and mission-critical equipment down to a watery grave. (As
happened on two occasions to the hovercraft party.) Or split the legs on the
Met tower if 5 m to .the left. It is interesting how much ice noise they report
even frozen on the floe.

Update: looks like those big leads arose as single CW torquing failure during
an "attempted rotation". The wind shifted. I'll add the whole time series in a
bit ... taking screenshots off https://www.polarview.aq/arctic saves trying to
locate the Polarstern on a huge downloads.

Back to the buoys. Here are the drift/delivery paths of 64 iabp buoys near the
Mosaic area. There are 3 more, I think, with short identifiers and a slightly
different format, not shown. Some have occasional -ve entries. At some point
the id number should be related to buoy type.
Current list is attached as txt file.

The weather forecasts are becoming increasingly interesting for anything that
may be Fram bound . The floe will be going with the flow at quite a pace and
may be seriously challenged by wind and wave if forecasts verify . b.c.

    floe may be seriously challenged by wind and wave if forecasts verify

Right. It is the unevenness in the stress applied by the wind to the floe and
vicinity that wrenches the ice around. It would not be disruptive to the
Polarstern's floe if the entire ice pack were rotating uniformly unconstrained
by CAA land, but it isn't.

It has not been possible so far to predict ice motion from weather forecasts;
one of the goals of Mosaic is a five-day ice forecast.

The small crack that went through camp the other day was part of a much larger
and potentially more damaging event. While leads can open any time of the year,
the ice today has not set up enough to resist deformation.

The Polarstern did not get the worst of it in the 16-19 October event but a lot
of the Mosaic experiments in the Deployed Camp will have to be moved (or
reconsidered). Quite a bit of the floe appears to be rotated, stretched and
rearranged as shown in the three levels of zoom. The 4th image shows the
enveloping swath of 2º of latitude and even more dramatic ice ridges and
fissures.

The lower part of the figure captures hourly positions of the Polarstern over
24 hours. This wild ride comes after relatively banal displacements since
mooring on the floe on Oct 04.

Here is more of a landscape view of the event. Click to play.

What happened to the buoys -- were any lost? No, all are reportingl Here it
would be interesting to show locations of nearby buoys before, during and
after. Since some of the 72 buoys deployed already by Mosaic are close to the
Polarstern and report twice an hour, a sudden glitch in their positions would
show ice mechanical failure happened catastrophically.

If the event unfolded relatively slowly over several hours or days (or if it is
still ongoing in the next days), that too should show up clearly. Thus the buoy
array provides a time-resolved history of the event at a finer scale possible
with 1-2 daily Sentinel-1 imagery.

Buoy positions need to be plotted on top of a relevant lat,lon range on S1
imagery. A choice like 84-86, 130-134 might work for several weeks to come.
Most of the buoys can sense and signal when they are in open water.

Attached are the last 227 hours the sailwx database to 19 Oct 2019 as csv. It
does show some exceptional winds on the 19th and also some unexpected ship
displacements post-mooring. I extracted those with a descending sort.

I collected current positions of 69 Mosaic buoys on Oct 19th (after the event)
from IADP's database. It is more tedious to collect them for Oct 16th (not
done). I then subtracted buoy lat,lon from the current position of the
Polarstern to obtain distances for latitude (0.1º is 11.1 km) and simple
differences for longitude. The graphic captures some of the closest buoys. The
full database is attached as a csv file.

Another day or two and the Polarstern might be right back where it started from
(first image). It turns out that PolarView is a full day ahead of
mosaic_multisensor which will not post its map of Oct 20th until tomorrow.

We like to have the news here first: the animation (which needs a click) shows
the movement over the last 18 hours. Some leads are narrowing; others may be
freezing over. Note the later frame is S1A, the other is from S1B. The
Polarstern's position is shown by a white star in the scene overview.

The 180 ms close-up (3x served by PolarView) shows things have not totally
settled down at the floe. One has to wonder how Mosaic deals with distortions
and displacements given electric and LAN cables are laid out a km or more onto
the ice.

None of the images here are rotated; 135ºE is the vertical; south is up,
Greenland is down. The ship voted to have north up in their maps which has
unfortunate effects as the longitude changes. Sentinel 1AB images come
perfectly aligned day after day; resolution and comparisons are , corrupted by
rotation.

Technical note: If the 16-bit jp2 files had been used instead of 8-bit
screenshots of the jpg offerings (and all the available dates since the 17th),
image quality might significantly improve on enlarged floe time series.

An interesting issue arises matching contrast in images from different S1
satellites. Even if they carry the 'same' instrument, the viewing angle might
be quite different and non-nadar over the floe as the 'filmstrips' show. One
approach is to hold the sharper image fixed (after optimization exploiting the
16-bit) and adjust the second so that its histogram matches. This eliminates
distraction arising from wildly different initial contrasts. The quickest way
of doing that is using the middle slider (gamma) in Gimp's Level tool.

Ultimately, if floe surface roughness has changed between the two timestamps or
if ridge reflections are taken from different orbital perspectives, the risk of
artifacts remains. At some point though, given consistency between multiple
scenes, Mosaic's selected floe itself must be changing.

First amateur attempts towards a presentation of ice deformation. Here showing
3 mosaic buoys, chosen for their roughly equilateral relative positions using
iabp coordinates to 4decimal place and Polarstern rough location to only 1dp,
from day 281-291(earlier today). Polarstern coords are hourly and have been
duplicated to match the 30m buoy coords.
300234068222000, Meeris Pbuoy
300234068225020 listed on iabp as IT (Ice tracker)
300234068226020, Meeris Pbuoy

Deformation is most noticable during day 286-7.
Distances shown are calculated using octave mapping which appears to produce
results lower than that of the haversine method possibly due to the high
latitudes. Will look into fixing that.
I haven't yet found PS location to more than 1dp

Me either. We need to write a Meereisportalfragenklarstellungenverantwortliche
about that. It should be served off the buoy list and in the legend to
mosaic_multisensor. The ship should know its GPS better than any buoy -- maybe
by the minute, which would be very interesting for acceleration if they are
truly frozen. Bandwidth is limited but not that limited.

They also know stern-to-bow azimuthal angle (~heading/bearing) very accurately.
Not seen it. The other issue are the tracks of both the PS and AF as they came
and went to the floe. These have left 25m wide weaknesses in the ice that may
account for current or future lead re-openings. The AK (UCKZ) turned off its
beacon on 27th Sept.

Sailwx is peculiar mix of units: time in base[60] rather than elapsed decimal
UTC like unix, base[60] lat,lon instead of base[10], nautical miles, knots but
temperatures in ºC. Some of the buoys report in AM/PM instead of 24 hrs.
Nuisance in calculating elapsed times.

Should we be converting buoy profiler depths to fathoms? Calling in data from
the nearest pay phone booth to an answering machine? The problem is mariners
still using rolled nautical charts.

Quote

    Why is a ship's speed measured in knots? ... By the late 16th century,
    sailors had begun using a chip log to measure speed. In this method, knots
    were tied at uniform intervals in a length of rope and then one end of the
    rope, with a pie-slice-shape piece of wood (or “chip”) attached to it, was
    tossed behind the ship.


The difference between N 85°00' and N 85°01' is 1/60 of 111111 m or 1850 m. The
difference between E 132°42' and E 132°43' (at 85º.00') is (haversine) 161.5 m
but at 84º it is 193.7 m. So sailwx is not reporting to a consistent accuracy.

It seems like we could use hourly sailwx to update PS's position from the
latest S1AB but more dp are needed than sailwx provides. We are now 16 hours
past that S1A which was ~18 hours from the last mosaic_multisensor.

Sailwx reports N 85°00' E 132°42' now whereas it was at N 85°00' E 132°48' at
SIA but the satellite timestamp is to the second; the PS radar reflector was
not at N 85°00' but rather N 84° and change. Note that "Where is Polarstern"
--> Meereis --> sailwx.

So where are they getting these mediocre numbers from? How could they know the
barometric pressure and wind speed if not from the PS's meteorological report?
That has even worse lat,lon precision than sailwx. And reports in "local time"
rather than UTC (though that is in the csv link).

The wind has picked up to 19 knots from 140º (Novaya Sibir) which is 35.2 km/
hr. The rule of thumb is ice will move at 1% of that or 35 km/hr which pencils
out to 8.4 km/day or 4.% longer than the base blue arrow in the legend to
mosaic_multisensor. Because of the coriolis force and boundary conditions, the
ice moves at a significant offset from the wind, here more SZ-ward.

Staff is not likely to be empowered to provide information without supervisory
approval from the
Meereisportalfragenklarstellungenverantwortlicheabteilungsleiter.

The PS has yoyo-ed back to N 85°00' E 132°48' where it was 18 hours ago per
sailwx, despite the steady wind from the south.

Some dimensions are noted on the lead that opened up on the 17th based on the
1140 pixels between 84.6 and 84.9º which is 3/10ths of a 111 km degree of
latitude.

    sailwx shipdump is in decimal degrees. They've also reserved 6 decimal
    places but PS only uses 1 ;)

Nice find. I had been going to the wrong shipdump link which forbids access.
Very weird; the Akademik Fedorov was reporting their GPS lat,lon to four
decimal points before they stopped transmitting, eg 72.2806, 25.6314.

Whoever in Mosaic who produces the daily red overlay of the PS position seems
to have access to the four dp position and hourly data (unless it is just
fanciful hand-tracing). So we know that even at northern latitudes the accuracy
is still there.

Once again, PolarView is on the job with today's S1B image with the floe and
ship easily seen. The overlay from sailwx then picks up where PV left off at
2:00 am and carries position and weather forward to 9:00 am (though at the
useless 1 decimal). Meanwhile, the most recent PS position on mosaic
multisensor is dated 5:00 am on the 19th though the acquisition date is said
the 20th.

The winds are again strong from the south. The open leads have gone from black
(open water or nilas) to white (frozen-over but very thin ice). These will be
recurrent weaknesses throughout the winter.

Oct-04 2300, 85.1, 134.0
Oct-21 0900, 85.1, 132.7
Polarstern net drift to date: 12.4 km
Planned drift to Svalbard: 1593 km so 0.8% of mission accomplished in 4.7% of
year's journey.

Overall ice pack motion the last 2-3 days, as seen on OsiSaf below, has been
unusual: favorable for the ship but not really characteristic of positive NAO
anti-cyclonic circumpolar drift of recent winters. In fact, the last 3-4 days
have seen a small ice cyclonic motion wandering towards Svalbard.

This will provide a bit of Fram export which has been entirely lacking since
spring but does not represent a return to winter pattern of recent centuries
(wreck of Jeanette) or (going by C14 of larch driftwood on Morris Jesup) recent
millennia.

There seems to be a mystery ship out there in the thick ice well above the Fram
Strait that is declining to identify itself. R/V icebreaker or a commercial oil
tanker or ore carrier? Position is jumping around so perhaps it represents
several ships who have turned off their call signs. It is reporting lat,lon to
two decimals.

Lots of ship traffic in the West Greenland Current. The one-time MMSI
transmission at 89ºN is possibly the two recreational hikers. The issuing
authority FCC has never heard of MMSI # = 513212925; the US Coast Guard doesn't
seem to have search.

Here is the side-by-side that goes with the animation above. The bright dot is
the Polarstern; the images are aligned to it. The S1B images are matched in
contrast and enlarged 3x with sinc.  The AK can also be seen up against another
floe on Oct 5th, not far to the south (up, not shown).

This series will be expanded to all available dates as time permits, including
pre-mooring dates. That has to be done carefully in stages because the bright
white dot of the Polarstern won't be there as reference point, plus the ice is
very mobile earlier in the autumn. However the Sept 30th and Sept 23rd (bottom)
are readily found. They are S1B and S1A respectively.

While changes are apparent over the last month in the floe selected for Mosaic,
we don't know exactly what they mean on the ground nor what they portend for
the future, especially for the white 'Fortress' area.

    There seems to be a mystery ship out there in the thick ice well above the
    Fram Strait that is declining to identify itself. R/V icebreaker or a
    commercial oil tanker or ore carrier? Position is jumping around so perhaps
    it represents several ships who have turned off their call signs. It is
    reporting lat,lon to two decimals.

    Lots of ship traffic in the West Greenland Current. The one-time MMSI
    transmission at 89ºN is possibly the two recreational hikers.


I wonder is that "mystery ship" the Pangaea. The boat that dropped of Mike Horn
and Borge Ousland and has now made its way around north of Svalbard. Mike and
Borge were dropped off on Sept 25th and are due to be collected north of
Svalbard.

They were to be dropped off at 85º. I wonder if the mystery call was an update
on their progress towards the pole or reporting a major delay or emergency
situation. They are not within range of Polarstern helicopters or anything
else. It is -8ºC, dark. with a chilling 23 knot wind. S1AB doesn't cover the
pole area; big leads may have opened and not be safe to cross. Nansen had to
turn back when he ran into a huge area of ridge complexes too laborious to
cross.

The ice is showing a lot of daily deformation in that area as well as Mosaic's
for this late in October. The Ice Camp moved a surprising amount towards the
pole (down) in the 2.5 hrs between S1A/S1B passes. The first ascat shows the
last 16 days and runs faster than the two images of the floe.

The second shows 30 days to the 21st and some unexpected garlic press out
M'Clure Strait and possible beginnings of Fram loss. However nothing special is
happening around the pole.

Here attempting to show buoy locations in the immediate mosaic/polarstern area
using delaunay triangulation. At some point we choose  a smaller subset of
reliably reporting buoys and use the triangle data available from the code to
attempt to show pressure and relaxation stresses placed on the ice by local
movement. This can be done in octave using a virtual 3rd dimension (I[DEL: hope
:DEL]think)
Only 10hours are shown in the attached gif (click to run) over day293-4, chosen
due to some activity to the north east. Labelling is problematic due to the
close location of some buoys, reporting times and dropouts. Anyway, it's a
rough overview for now.

Very very nice!

Just some odds and ends...

... Looking for a nice polar stereographic graticule to overlay coordinates on
daily S1 radar of the Mosaic floe, I noticed that Excel can really draw a nice
one (1st graphic), even 1º labelled longitude steps if you make a column of 360
1's and then use the chart called 'radar' in the 'other' submenu of the chart
menu. However it is difficult to get the diameter large enough to match that of
latitude circles in mosaic multisensor.

... Some basic spreadsheet column statistics on Sailwx columns since the
Polarstern moored on its floe Oct 4th (2nd graphic): max and min on lat,lon
show the floe has resided in a very small box 84.8-85.2 by 131.6-136.2. The
floe has wandered around some but today is practically back where it came from
on Day 19. The wind rose averages to 185º with maximum sustained speed of 31.1
knots; temperatures to -12.9ºC.

update: 2019-Oct-23  midnight   85.3   130.5 (record lon)   100º  17.5 knot
wind from 100º (southwest).

... In terms of plotting buoy movement over the S1 imagery, note first that an
way to get daily position updates is to capture the IADP front page and sort
down to the Mosaic floes (87 active now!). These only have lat,lon to two
decimals which is not great.

... Gimp has a most excellent xy grid tool buried in filters > render > pattern
> grid which you can set to convenient sub-multiple of the number of pixels
between to latitude circles (111.111 km) to show scale in km. Taking lat,lon to
r,θ to x,y buoy coords allows plotting them with a mouse 'go to' relative to
the Polarstern reflector on the ice. (The inset is 3x enlarged.)

If the Polarview capture (as high res jpg) contains two longitude lines and two
latitude lines symmetric about the vertical (135º), then the grid tool can be
set to chop horizontal chords between vertices into equal line segments.
Connect the dots gives accurate intermediate longitude lines.

-- By merging lat,lon fields from the Sailwx db into a list of appropriate urls
for greenland-down Nullschool, then opening all the tabs at once in a browser,
stacking whole window screenshots to get them in register, then cropping down
to the info panel set to preferred units, you can rapidly compare wind,
pressure and temperature at the drifting Polarstern's location at the time to
GFS values there.

The day is coming when this will be a routine overlay, time series, strain
gauge, lead and ridge detector!

What about shorter names for the buoys and color-coding by type?  Like 2019P156
(don't need the 2019 really) and blue for type SVP etc. I am seeing 7-8 types.

I cropped a bit, flipped it 180º and added a white circle around the
Polarstern's position at the time S1A went over on Oct 21st.

Also attaching the latest csv for the 95 buoys that IADP is carrying for Mosaic
deployments. Also the previous master list that showed Meereisportal's
compilation too. Not yet brought in the latest from MEP nor made sure all the
buoys are still in play and relevant.

I can scarcely believe they are flying out in helicopters in these 21 knot
winds to set buoys. Maybe done earlier and just now trickling down to the buoy
databases.

A-team / uniquorn thank you so much for all your hard work. It's really
appreciated. Results so far - even if tweaking required - already look most
impressive. Your visuals will enable the rest of us to get a real feel for the
dynamics of the ice cover in the CAB.

Shorter names would be good. Run a poll for the names? Only joking,
buotymcbuoytface1 isn't shorter. I'm reading straight from iabp buoy id but
could easily add a friendlier name if a .csv with an alt name for all mosaic
buoys came along. The next runs will be north up. I forgot about that. If the
output is too inaccurate for overlay I'll start looking at projection again.

Their accounts of the nature of those floes and why they gave a false thick
reading is interesting.  Any thoughts on whether this would have an effect on
the measurements of volume, A-team?

I'll look at the BBC in a bit (it is dated 23 Oct but was written prior to Oct
4th docking); these reports are a big help. An earlier BBC piece also has
valuable tidbits about ice thickness -- and how the Akademic Fedrorov plowed
through a promising floe by mistake. I attached a map of current ship location
relative to the Russian EEZ which the Polarstern is eager to avoid.

https://www.bbc.com/future/article/
20191014-climate-change-arctic-expedition-finds-itself-on-thin-ice

The news, blogs and tweets are scattered incoherently all over the internet and
posted at irregular, unpredictable intervals:

Quote

    Team ICE identified the site for the remote-controlled underwater robot on
    the floe. The team made a hole in the ice. The site named "oasis" will be
    used to measure ice thickness, light conditions, and physical and
    biochemical parameters.

https://blogs.helmholtz.de/polarstern/en/

There are definite limits to how much we can guess what is going on from
Iridium buoy reports and S1AB imagery. The latter we cannot count on for the
coming year as these satellites have many other users and other commitments.
The floe is drifting zonally rather rapidly to the west despite (because) of
the wind not blowing that way. I added East vs west is confusing in these
north-down images so I remember it by thinking of the Far East. The Polarstern
is planning on the Fram off Svalbard which is like 82º,0º.

We still have not determined why Sailwx is truncating lat,lon to one decimal
when the buoys have GPS reporting to 4. Likely the Polarstern is doing the
truncating, by an error in a setting or for some unknown purpose. (Sailwx is
just a tech guy in Seattle who likes to sail Puget Sound.)

The image below would make a suitable frame for a nice graticule. PolarView has
put on the red overlay on the jpgs every 4º of longitude -- this should have
been 3º or 5º as 90º is not divisible by 4.

Some other bright reflectors are confusing matters. These could be installed
equipment, possibly radar emitters near S1AB antenna frequencies, or other
ships. The AK has turned off its beacon altogether and possibly returned to
Murmansk. Three other icebreakers are also bringing logistic support at some
point, notably fuel for the helicopters. Polar-6 and -7 will be flying
scientists on and off though the ice is not strong enough yet to bring out the
PistonBullys to plow the runway in Area 3, which has undergone significant
deformation over the last ten days.

The second image shows the broader context of shocking Fram-ward ice motion the
last couple of days, an overdue flash freeze in the Laptev that is not quite
happening because of strong wind mixing, and continuing resilience to
thickening on the icepack periphery.

Here Smos shows putative ice thinness but cannot measure it in the vicinity of
the Polarstern or Mosaic buoys. Smos/Smap is no doubt a better edge product
(nilas) but it has only appeared sporadically this month, most recently on the
19th. The BBC doesn't state what the Mosaic planning team was using for
satellite ice thinness, perhaps IceSat2 (laser) rather than Smos (radar) and
certainly not Piomas (theory).

Freeboard is so minimal that salt water has washed over the floes, depositing
saline over the ice and wetting surface snow which fools radar into thinking it
has located the seawater underneath the ice. These regions are thus dark (radar
adsorbent) on Sentinel-1 while ridges of floe collisions are whitish because of
surface roughness at the 5 cm scale of S1 wavelength.

It looks like I was way out with my complete guess. Here is a better attempt
with fresher eyes. I ignored attempting to match a buoy to the polarstern
instead concentrating on the radar spots and the graticules. The point don't
quite match with all the radar spots but most are close.
Here using the polarview jpg and todays iabpbuoys at 06hrs. The gif is large

Nice work on buoys! I didn't realize at first that it was a 2-frame animation.
It looks good at the click-size. That is great to have the buoy network over a
Sentinel base layer.

Compiled highlights (with edits and commentary in brackets) of the Polarstern
cruise to Oct 23rd from screen scrapes of twitter, email, blogs, depts, BBC and
newspapers. Too long but good to have it in one place (that won't get lost or
deprecated to invisibility by google).

Most interesting information on thickness and near-loss of equipment and power
line to ridging and shearing -- we knew from S1AB that things were morphing
around on the selected floe but not exactly how. Is this going to get worse as
time goes on, or will freezing solid help? (The too-fancy expedition web site
does not allow text copying so screen shots have to be taken.)

First note a very important result  from R Kwok et a; about overall Arctic
Ocean calibration of IceSat2 by simultaneous airplane lidar: measured
elevations agree to within 2-4 cm. The April flights did not quite reach the
Polarstern/Mosaic floe but more recent Icesat-2 orbits may have.

Matthew Shupe: : how to get all of our different apparatus installations fitted
into a limited and challenging space. Frozen melt ponds are to be avoided as
they are likely to melt once again next summer. Plus some melted all the way
through. Hummocks are safer for most equipment; the heavy stuff goes on the
outer wall of the Fortress. with the Met Hut  tucked up against a big plate of
ice jutting up 2m inthe air. This may cause a drifting challenge.

We flagged a power line path out to all of the major installations. The ‘Ocean
City’ type  power hubs weigh 700 kg but are moveable as they are installed on
top of 3 snowboards. The 700 m road out to Met City was smoothed out with picks
and shovels.They are able to log in remotely from one station to the next to
fix issues that arise.

Carrying a big breaker bar to probe the ice conditions, I learned back at SHEBA
that if you lightly throw such a bar down to the surface from about 10 inches
up and it DOES NOT break through, the ice is safe to walk on. Deep snow at
places, making walking difficult.

But inside the Fortress was actually quite appealing. Nice courtyards of flat
ice surrounded by sturdy walls. Eventually we made our way to a broad valley
heading out to the far end of the floe, with a gateway to exit the fortress.
Heading south we found wide, open and mostly flat plains made of frozen over
melt ponds (30 cm thick ice) and some older hummocks (~100 cm thick). At the
southern extreme we looked out over a narrow lead of open water, perhaps 15-20m
across. 

Took the ship’s helicopter over to AkF to give a lecture on “coupled system
research” to the MOSAIC School.

IThe ARM instruments are set up and will hopefully run smoothly for the rest of
the campaign during the drift. In case of any trouble, our amazing technicians
will be there to tackle any issues. Even today new cracks and pressure ridges
appeared in the ice in the middle of a power line, challenging our efforts to
set up our camp. We prepare ourselves for the next ARM adventure on Andoya, a
Norwegian island located within the Arctic Circle.

BBC x 2:
“With other floes we’ve encountered [data on 16 floes studied not released] we
have clipped a piece off the edge with the ship to see how thick it is. A red
and white two-meter stick, painted at 50cm intervals, sticks out from a lower
deck to help judge how thick it is. The solid layer of blue ice in between snow
on top and mushy rotten ice below [incompletely melted in summer, not newly
forming], has rarely made it past 0.5 m.

The new layer [FYI from last winter not affected by past melt season] at the
top can support equipment weight. The older rotten ice below [ice accretes to
the bottom; this is newer than the ice above, is new ice on the floe edge
meant?] is unreliable, although there is a question about whether a thicker
layer of it helps or hinders refreezing during winter.

The investigated floe’s surface is level with the water that is freezing at its
edges [freeboard should be 10% of total thickness if it were solid ice:
Bernouli]. There is no protection or refuge. Instead, the floe merges
seamlessly with the sea around it, rising in the distance to what could be a
more rugged area towards the centre.

“The thing is, I’m not sure this piece of ice is even safe to walk on. That
ridged area has holes and gaps. Take survival suits and floats,” says
atmospheric physicist Markus Rex.

“In that ridged area there are holes and gaps,” says Rex, gesturing towards the
central region. “It would be good to have those survival suits. Take flotation
too.”

The Polarstern parks well away from a floe of interest so as not to damage it.
A refrozen lead is covered by a thin layer of blackish-grey ice. The ship’s
bridge radar augments what they can see. They don’t clip any ice off the edge
with the ship to see how thick it is.

The edges of the "fortress" ice floe seem thin and waterlogged but in the
distance the ice rises up and becomes thicker.

But the ship has to cut through a neighboring piece of ice instead. Large
fragments bob vertically next to the hull to reveal a cross-section over 1 m.
The sea ice in the region where the Mosaic mission have been searching has
turned out to be much thinner than they were expecting. Floes are large but
drill easily and could easily have disintegrated. [Only anecdotal data from
EmBird surveys and drilling has been released]. 

Foes identified as >80cm thick from satellite images [IceSat2? Smos?] have
turned out <40 cm from sled EM transects and drilling “Put that ship alongside
such a floe and the first storm will press this ship right through it sideways.
We budgeted to look at 20 floes,” says Rex.

The selected floe has a strong central section, with ice depths of up to 5m. It
appears to have been created from several floes merging under high pressure. It
appears as a luminous, bright patch in the otherwise dark grey satellite
pictures the team are using. The inhomogeneous rugged jumble has drop-offs of
3m.

Beyond the fortress, there are two large flatter zones. The larger of these two
[south side] appears to be made of ice typical of the region. It would allow
the expedition to study what is happening to the ordinary, fast-disappearing
young Arctic sea ice.

The ice around the ship started forming about 300 days ago – around two months
later than the usual onset of the Arctic winter freeze. Those two months of
missing freezing make a big difference, reducing the ice thickness by around
half.

After two days, the floe, clearly very dynamic, has already changed. A large
crack runs through the ice from west to east, almost severing about a fifth of
the floe beyond the northern edge of the fortress. The floe is in a shear zone,
with currents [a misunderstanding: no water currents exist in the central AO]
pulling it in different directions. This section of the floe is not expected to
last long.

The Polarstern moors to the fortress floe at 85ºN, 137ºE on Oct 4th but not as
originally planned by gently lining the ship up to an edge but instead by
ramming 500m towards the fortress. The captain wants to the ship securely
embedded to get the robust mooring. “This may be one of the last years we can
do this kind of expedition,” says Matt Shupe.

Some ice terms: frazil, shuga, nilas, pancake, grease, cake ice and frost
flowers.

As sea water freezes, it first forms crystal discs known as frazil, eventually
forms a suspension in the water known as grease ice, which creates an
iridescent sheen like an oil slick. Waves and wind can compress the ice
crystals together to form pancake ice that floats on the ocean surface. As
these pancakes grow bigger they become cakes. On calmer seas, the frazils grow
to form a continuous expanse of dark, glassy layer of ice, like a windowpane on
top of a black sea. Shuga ice is slushy mess created by spongy white lumps that
bob in the water.

Researchers at Russia’s AARI have been tracking ice floes for Mosaic in the
Central Arctic Ocean all summer. They have been using data from several
satellites[?], hoping to find those which survive the storms and melting.

Rex points out a darker oval in the image – the darker the ice appears, the
thinking goes, the thicker and more robust the ice should be. The ice in the
target region is looking like it will be 80cm thick, according to the data
available. “We’d prefer one meter, one meter 20 (3 to 4ft) – but 80cm can
work,” says Rex.

They will drift with the floe on an unpredictable path across the polar region,
creeping on average from east to west through the year. But, choose a bad floe,
or even a good floe in the wrong place, and the camp is at risk of collapse.

“What happened to N-ice would be really, really bad [4 forced relocations as
Atlantic swells and melt broke up their floes]. We need to avoid that. A large
fraction of model trajectories ends up in the N-ice area [2º north of
Svalbard].

But other drift trajectories end their year’s drift stuck at the North Pole.
Another gets into a danger zone off the coast of Greenland. [Floes never pile
up against land in Greenland; floes never pass through the Nares Strait from
their starting position.]

Another promising floe has 30 cm of compact snow over a deep layer of
translucent blue ice that transitions to  brownish mushy honeycomb that easily
sloughs off as sludge. However the Akademik Federov has sailed straight through
it leaving a track visible on satellite. However it turned out to be only 30 or
40cm thick so worthless for an ice camp.

Re-interpretation of radar imagery: the discovery of so many thin floes lead
the team to rethink satellite imagery. Previously the idea was that the thicker
ice absorbs more radar signal from satellites overhead and so appear darker in
the resulting image. But tests on those floes shows that this interpretation is
wrong. The dark patches on the images are in fact showing something else
entirely.

On the first floe, there was very little freeboard. “When you remove the snow,
the surface was wet,” says Stefan Hendricks. The floe was flooded with
seawater. The layer of salt water reduces the reflection of the radar back to
the satellite. “Our idea is dark floes are actually the thin ones having low
freeboard.”

Last couple of days were spent retrieving four Ocean Bed Seismometers that had
been collecting data for the past year at the bottom of the ocean, almost 4
kilometers (2.5 miles) deep. The scientists responsible for these devices had
remotely triggered their release from the ocean bed and had to find them among
the ice once they surfaced. It took almost two days, but finally all four were
found and hoisted on board.

3D delaunay deformation of a random set of buoys with no dropouts during days
293-296 (yesterday's data). The z-axis shows the change in distance between
buoys over the last hour for each frame. I still need to check that the
distance is related to the correct buoy but labelling is tricky. Distance is
still calculated using octave mapping.

The icepack continues to display quite dynamic behavior yesterday and today.
Infrastructure deployed off the Polarstern will continue to be challenged by
shifting ice within the selected Mosaic floe, even within the thicker Fortress
area.

The top animation, at the native S1AB resolution, shows a large region of pack
ice about the ship attempting to rotate CCW but experience brittle failure as a
large rift opens in the upper right (north pole is down) as it shears like a
left-lateral strike-slip fault right through the selected floe. 

The 3x zoom shows numerous deformations within the immediate vicinity of the
Polarstern that cannot be favorable for instruments already set up. Some of
these could no be replaced within the time frame of the drift.

Was the ROV rift -- so close to the PS -- set up by previous ice-weakening
passages of the two icebreakers? No map has been produced of those routes as
yet. Sailwx is not receiving accurate GPS coordinates. Alternatively, the PIs
spoke of the Polarstern itself stressing the ice as a very large target for the
wind. 'Moored' calls up an image of thick chains, mooring lines or massive ice
anchors. However none of the images seem to be showing these. How frozen-in can
a ship be in weak ice?

Because the ice has deteriorated so much over the years, not thickening as much
because of later onset of freeze season (ie missing autumn months), expedition
leaders have said this is the last possible year this drift could have been
done. (Perhaps it was a few years earlier than that.)

Right. That was surprising to read that the ROV camp ice drifted back and forth
repeatedly across the bow during the night. With Sentinel-1AB, there is just
not that time resolution. Twice a day but with only a couple of hours
separating the scenes. Today, S1A finished up its strip without quite catching
the Polarstern.

Acquired: 24-10-2019 05:38:14 UTC S1B
Acquired: 24-10-2019 02:22:09 UTC S1A (not)

If someone here has the time, it would be great to download and mark up the 2x
zoom below with displacement arrows and lead openings/ridge closings.

If someone here has a lot of time, it would be great to download the sailwx
wind speed and direction since the Oct 4th and correlate it (or at least draw
the overlay) with the blue Osisaf arrows on the daily mosaic_multisensor time
series. The ice does not move in the direction of the wind but rather variably
to its left (to Nansen's great puzzlement).

There are some geodesy issues being glossed over. The shear animations are
co-registered to the Polarstern white dot on the radar. That involves moving
one of the images over pixel by pixel rectilinearly until the dots line up.
However they are at different longitudes so a rotation would be better to do
before the translation. The differences are very slight and rotations degrade
image quality which is not great to begin with.

Sentinel satellites go through a lot of complicated steps to produce the
projected images that are archived. The position of the Polarstern relative to
scene corners seems to affect local contrast and image quality. As might time
of day, mixing A and B, or slabs of ice changing orientation. S1B is producing
better focus ... it might have benefitted from on-board instrument improvements
given the later time of its launch.

Whatever. The Mosaic ice camp is undergoing serious rearrangements. What does
it mean to study the same floe for a year if it is not the same floe the next
dat? (Heraclitus 2544 bce)

It looks like the wind is picking up again after some hours of lull. The higher
wind speeds drive ice deformation, the stress going roughly as the cube. And
this stress might be quite unevenly applied to the icepack. When the floes and
interstitial ice are weak, as they are this autumn, we may well see serious
further morphological changes in the Mosaic fortress tomorrow.

There are NO independent surface water currents in this part of the Arctic
Ocean shearing ice. There is NO ongoing surge of water in from the Pacific. The
immense Gulf Stream (WGC) flow into the AO is a thousand feet (300m) below the
ice. Its murky diffuse return path in under study in Mosaic. 

The csv file attached merges today's IADP and Meereisportal buoy databases and
proposes a systematic names for the buoy types. There are 87 new buoys that we
know of.

Deformation test suggesting there is still significant movement up to 7am this
morning. A few buoys reported till 10am but not really enough to run a separate
subset. There are 32 in this animation.
The iabp page updates a few times a day(not sure of the exact times yet), the
mosaic buoy data less often.

#74 above: fabulous! innovative!

Note on #75 that the 'annual' IDBP drift background (upper left) is conceptual,
not really quantitative and doesn't show the last few years specifically much
correlate the buoy with the current situation (which has been no export since
early June, see wipneus' chart).

I am slowly scraping in the initial dates of deployment and lat,lon for the
buoys in IABP but not (yet?) in Meereis. Slowly because they use day number
instead of day.month.year like Meereis which itself is dumb because it does not
sort chronologically. The ones below uses month.day.year

Still checking on what these SIMB3 buoys have to do with IABP and Meereis. The
first four are important because they are part of Mosaic and measure snow + ice
thickness (such as it is). The IMEI are a bit short and do not correspond to
anything in the other two databases.

Three Sentinels today but spaced quite closely in time. Together with one from
yesterday, the icepack dynamics can be seen to have calmed considerable as
winds remained moderate. However individual pieces of the pack are still moving
independently though in a constrained manner.

What effect this is having on deployed Mosaic equipment awaits the Oct 25th
report from the Polarstern but that does not speak to what S1AB are showing.

OsiSaf is showing yet another day of dramatic trans-polar drift; recall these
show two days of ice movement with 3x arrows so overall exaggerate ice
displacement by 6x. Consistent movement en bulk for several days is not
conducive to shears or fractures as stress is evenly distributed.

The movements bear some resemblance to 2D brownian motion:

Quote

    random motion of larger particles suspended on a fluid resulting from their
    collision with faster moving smaller particles.This pattern typically
    alternates random fluctuations in a particle's position inside a fluid
    sub-domain with a relocation to another sub-domain.

    Each relocation is followed by more fluctuations within the new closed
    area. There exists no preferential direction of flow as in transport
    phenomena. More specifically, the fluid's overall linear and angular
    momenta remain at zero over time.

    This motion is named after the botanist Robert Brown, who first described
    the phenomenon in 1827, while looking through a microscope at pollen
    [actually, starch granules inside] of the plant Clarkia pulchella [from
    Idaho] in water. [wiki]

I had to increase the distance scale on the deformation test from 0.001km to
0.0016 to avoid clipping the lower points on yesterday's buoy data. That's
compression so perhaps those leads have a bit more ridging now. It doesn't look
like a smooth ride but this software presentation needs some verification from
a ground report.
If you have a wider angle version of the gif above a bouy overlay with some
distances might be one way of verifying. (Post temporarily if very large?)
tech note: 2 buoys had dropouts so only 30buoys in this ani. Good day for
gardening so no coding today.

With people tramping 'all over' the designated floe, will it freeze thicker due
to there being less snow insulation?  If they sprayed some fresh water on the
snow (but not enough to create an ice rink), would that strengthen the floe
'faster'?  Or would this create cracks between ridges (without extra
accumulation) and flats (with extra accumulation)?  (Who knew that people will
[or will want to] do geoengineering on whatever piece of the Earth they find
themselves?)

They are obviously not using solar panels for electricity. Will the ship's
diesel cause noticeable particulate contamination?

    contamination of air samples, trampling

You can see the smokestack belching bunker fuel exhaust in the all the images,
including the one just above. They have to keep the generators running; I don't
think propulsion is ever engaged to maintain position. Trampling: they laid out
paths and reserved pristine areas.

Mitigation of 'observer effects' like these and many more are addressed in the
122-planning document. Might write Captain Schwarze with your other ideas?

Oh yes, very large. From a practical standpoint, it is easiest to capture the
IABP table for the 25th which shows the "latest' lat,lon and then find the
smallest bounding box needed for the S1 capture, after first counting the
pixels between 85º and 86º whose distance in km we know.

The drift so far has gotten out of bounds on mosaic_multisensor but if we
cropped the S1 to 84-86.5º latitude by 138-124º E longitude, we would have the
whole Polarstern drift to date with room to spare and hopefully capture most of
the current and near-future buoy positions.

Note though that at full S1 resolution, the box 84-86º, 140-120º is 4748 x 6484
pixels. That's manageable as a grayscale but doubtful for the forum. It would
be better to retain full resolution until the buoys are placed at their 4 dp
precision, then crop and reduce the crop maybe 8:1. The PS' position we don't
know but fortunately we can have the white dot and the exact timestamp.

That scale is shown approximately below; we could go to 1400 x 1400 for better
display of buoys. The idea is, if we wait a couple weeks, the new positions
will still be in the bounding box allowing net displacement arrows. The key is
to start with a sharp S1 with good contrast. Replace the jpg version with the
contrast adjusted jp2 (which lacks lat,lon overlay) at the end.

I have frozen today's IABP page and looked at a few data entries, one of which
shows the time of last buoy report to be 297.5625 which is actually Oct 24th at
1:30 pm rather than the 25th according to https://www.epochconverter.com/days/
2019 . Looking at another, 298.4167 which is 10:00 am on the 25th.

It would take a fair amount of work to walk each of the 85 data pages back to a
favorable and common S1 time. However we may need more than the two dp on the
front page to locate the buoys accurately enough on the image. Definitely
discard the outliers. Easy enough to convert columns of lat,lon to x,y and
scale up to pixel coords, float the paste of buoy name, color text by type.

I am curious though where these buoys were initially placed relative to the
Polarstern (but that would mean looking through a metric ton of S1AB) though we
can probably get relative to ice features such as fortress-like objects in many
other nearby floes by just placing them over a current S1.

It is astonishing that the Polarstern didn't document buoy placement carefully
on S1 at the time (ice and snow thickness too), maybe they did but that news
apparently didn't get shared with Meereisportal.

Sea Ice Drift. The PolarStern itself is a great big cliff that weighs 17,600
tons and a length of 118 metres. When the wind blows., a great big heavy sail.
Have they parked it where impact on the floe is minimal? Will it be trying to
move when the floe is not?

I am sure they have thought about it, but they tell me that in the Arctic
reality can be somewhat different from plans.

    The PolarStern itself is a great big heavy sail.

Indeed, that very risk is discussed in detail in direct quotes from the two
expedition co-leaders in the two BBC articles linked and summarized just above.

They also considered in detail the 100's of km of route swaths cut in the ice
by the Fedorov and Polarstern as they approached this and other floes, deployed
instruments on distant floes and exhanged staff and supplies.

The co-leaders further expressed concern that the Captain had rammed the ship
in too far and too fast to get nearer the Fortress. However the ship could
hardly be stably moored to the 30 cm slush on the periphery.

Like everyone else, the PI's had about zero accurate information in advance
about ice thickness and quality during the eight year onshore planning process.
One of the big reasons for Mosaic -- and the first thing they learned on-site
-- is no one knew how to interpret billion-euro radar satellite imagery.

I have a question too: how is that we have 1672 registered members and 324
current guests but cannot find a single person to step up on buoy observations
and real weather data now that we finally have some data. How about 0.1%
adopting a buoy class?

Arctic Ocean weather forecasts that don't assimilate any Arctic Ocean
information in their initializations -- what could possibly go wrong? 
Actually, a lot. Mosaic collects a great deal of half-hourly data speaking to
that. But no wx people here seem to be listening.

Imagined impacts from imaginary snowpacks on guesswork ice thickness when there
are 11 snow buoys and 14 IMBs reporting? The freeboard is so low that the snow
is soaking wet 300 km from the nearest open waters. Utah powder at one point
but what is the R value now?

In most years, 0-1 buoys are functioning unsteadily in sub-prime locations in
the Arctic Ocean. This fall, over 90 and counting. They were too clustered at
deployment but that will improve from  multitudinous drift trajectories.

Importantly, the buoy network will remain a coupled system of instruments.
Right now I've been putting up ad hoc base layers while uniq and macid write
code as dryland draws down daily buoy data for a PostgreSQL query interface  --
and that's just for co-location. We haven't gotten to coupling buoy content yet
or kriging up scalar, vector and tensor meshes, much less scaling to say 9000
buoy display.

A regular report on polarstern temperatures and pressure would be very helpful
if anyone can manage it. A comparison with gfs and ecmwf values for the same
location would also be interesting.

Here is today's update from 'follow-mosaic' -- the drift route to date, colored
by speed in knots. Because Mosaic does not release the Polarstern's half-hourly
GPS coordinates to the public except in a very broadly sense, we have only
daily Sentinel scenes (the PS is the white dot on radar) by which to measure
displacements.

I had to make a great many fixes to the original map. The legend is extremely
dithered so speed cannot be read off accurately along the route using a color
picker.

We looked for dead Mosaic buoys. They are 3 weeks in and have already lost 4 of
92 buoys. At this rate, by the end of the year they will have lost 63 buoys.
Two of them are AWI's.

Scatter plots below of 86 buoys on 26 Oct 2019 relative to Polarstern daily
positions per Sailwx were made possible by a very helpful free online tool
called https://scatterplot.online/ that is quite interesting for how it was
coded.

IADB does a nice job of separating out Mosaic buoys that have stopped reporting
(for a week or more). One was an oddity deployed at 81º/107º that only reported
for 16 hours. It might have been a field test but it has not been redeployed in
the sense of reporting again through Iridium. It did not record any sensor data
other than lat,lon.

Are these losses from poor design, manufacturing defects, inadequate QA, sensor
failure, bad batteries, inability to connect or upload data to Iridium,
ill-advised placement on a floe, or just bad luck in a harsh polar environment?

The emplacement floe might been become fragmented, washed over, crushed or
buried in a collision of floes, or vandalized by curious polar bears, resulting
loss of buoy function.

I definitely get the sense buoys are not tested overwinter near campus but
instead deployed out of the box, hoping for the best. This happens with
moorings too — the one in the Bering Strait was not field tested for software
loading before deployment.

I have not seen a lot curiosity over why buoys fail and how they might be made
more robust. Almost all seem home-made, with no two ad hoc design the same
rather than standardized manufacture. The buoy market is too small.

The two-person company that makes SIMB3 has sold a grand total of twelve. They
have not responded to my query about their peculiar IMEI notation and lack of
coordination with IABP or Meereisportal despite being part of Mosaic and on
Iridium.

The RS Aqua GPS buoys are 11-person corporate with brick and mortar in
Portsmouth, UK. They have made quite a diversity of marine sensors since the
1980's.

It is not clear that the failed GPS buoy below is theirs. The owner acronym
‘TUT’ is nowhere explained at IAPB acronyms but I was able to chase it down to
Taiyuan University of Technology in China who presumably built it. This type of
buoy (a TUT buoy) has a 4.5-m-long thermistor string, assembled using 150
thermistor sensors with an accuracy of 0.1 °C and vertical interval of 0.03 m.
The other 9 Mosai  TUT's are still reporting.

The Polarstern could perhaps retrieve the three failed buoys by helicopter as
they are still quite nearby and get at the failure mode. Mosaic has not
released any information (such as ice thickness) about the floes on which they
were installed. My sense is that they didn’t characterize installations
initially and don’t know where those floes are now. However we could do that
for them using S1 and the few days of GPS that they were able to send in.

UpTempo buoys are explained here:
http://psc.apl.washington.edu/UpTempO/

Quote

    UpTempO buoys are designed to measure ocean temperature in the euphotic
    (light-influenced) surface layer of the Polar Oceans. These relatively
    inexpensive ocean buoys are designed to be easily deployed in open water or
    sea ice – covered conditions. As sea ice thins and retreats more and more
    each summer, the magnitude of ocean surface warming is accelerating. Our
    main goal is to measure this warming.


Here are two very recent articles on current buoys and how the measure snow vs
ice thicknesses and internal flow temperature gradients.

The daily Mosaic one-paragraph blog + photo shows the 11m meteorological tower
being installed near the Polarstern. That is going to provide a better quality
stream of data than weather instruments on the ship's bridge that shows up in
the hourly meteorological database accessible from Meereisportal. (Sailwx has
the highlights.)

It is likely explained what this meteorological tower can do in the 122-page
planing document for cruise PS122/leg1. However they have limited internet
bandwidth and copious onboard secure data storage. We might not see anything
from this tower until it surfaces at the Pangea data archive (in 2023)

    Dear reader of the Polarstern weekly reports,

    In this place you are used to finding the Weekly Reports from the
    Polarstern Expeditions. During the MOSAIC Expedition there will be no
    weekly reports.


Pity. Those weekly reports from past cruises were first-rate. As was the
Helmholtz weekly blog on Mosaic. The last of those was posted 12 days ago.
https://blogs.helmholtz.de/polarstern

Ok, they are busy so the nrt news situation will remain limited. Is it being 
censored? In my opinion, yes. First, with 3 Sentinel images per day, we can see
for ourselves that the floe and Fortress are undergoing severe dynamic
rearrangements almost every day, often within consecutive Sentinel orbits only
98.6 minutes apart.

Imagery biases from variable angle of approach, time of scene, instrument
variation between satellites, lat/lon and temperature variation are all easily
ruled out by routine controls. The morphological changes observed raise the
question of what does it even mean to study the time evolution of the 'same'
floe when it isn't the same floe even three weeks into the planned year
(fortress rocker day2 vs day23 attached), or even hour to hour.

We've seen minimal mention of these events and no maps of Fortress changes in
the 20 days that have elapsed since the fantastic but undated, no-legend
laser-scanner DEM of ice camp was released on Oct 10th. Who would buy a laser
range-finder that couldn't report what the ranges were?

It's one thing to set up camp but it's another to keep it set up. They've had
two near misses already  with critical equipment that is all but impossible to
repair on the ship or replace with one on land. How much of the year will be
spent re-setting up camp; will data collection be discontinuous due to daily
damage to instruments and infrastructure?

To a certain extent, this happens every year on every Arctic cruise and was
expected. However this year the ice was very weak and thin, so options were
very limited. I think they made the right decision with the selected floe: yes,
better floes could be found farther north but these are much less likely to
drift significantly. Plus re-supply becomes very problematic in deep winter.

Further, peri-polar floes don't have the refrozen melt ponds, open water in
leads and freezing processes of FYI that are important to the scientific
mission. Farther south was out of the question: nothing solid enough to moor
on. Returning to port was out of the question; so is waiting for next year.

So apparently is reporting bad news. And we see that not just with this
particular floe but in every topic in climate change. 

For us to follow Mosaic without guidance from their end, the Sentinel radar
imagery and Iridium-transmitted reports from the buoys will be our best tools.
The image below looks at Sentinel coverage and its extensive area of no
coverage (Pole hole starts at 87.25º 165 km from NP, any longitude).

Should the buoys continue to die off, should the Polarstern drift out of
Sentinel view, we will have to rely on trickle-down from the Dr. Panglosses.
That's not a good idea when we're already having to tutor them on image
processing and querying of massively coupled data.

buoy location data, 0400hrs, day297-300. Some report at 0min, some at 30min.
Some report more often but the intermediate data is not included.

The first image looks at the two Sentinel images available for today, 28 Oct
2019. I've started adding Polarstern location, weather (wind direction, wind
speed knots, ºC) and smiley/frown distortion icons when there is room on the
image.

https://www.awi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/MET/PolarsternCoursePlot/
psobsedat.html

The other images look at the puzzling velocity kink along the Polarstern's
route dated 09 Oct 19. This occurred during a period of quite subdued winds. 
The odd motion of the Mosaic floe can be attributed to massive fracturing 
region several hundred km to the north (down in all imagery).

As vast far-away lead systems opened and closed, the Polarstern went around in
loops, experiencing almost no deformation. This will likely be the case for the
local buoy network too. Action-at-a-distance thus can affect the ship's
position superficially so needs to be disentangled from actual transpolar drift
and deformation going on simultaneously (3x version).

In this case, the ice closer to the pole is colder, older and thicker than the
recently graduated FYI at the Mosaic Ice Camp. As such, this northerly ice
cannot take up tensile stress by deformation of  weak interstitial ice.
Instead, brittle stress fractures occur and propagate long distances.

As the winter progresses, ice at the Polarstern's location will be become more
siimilar. Rifts like those seen at 85.5º could have catastrophic effects on
deployed equipment.

According to two closely spaced S1B images of Oct 29th (02:30 - 05:46 UTC), an
east-west pressure ridge or lead appeared between the Polarstern and the
equipment installations in the Ice Camp fortress. This may be related to an
earlier weakness that threatened the ROV camp; alternatively to icebreaker
tracks during floe selection.

The event may or may not be serious; there won't be another Sentinel pass until
02:31 tomorrow. No maps of any kind have been provided. Daily Sentinel ship
locations do not allow reconstruction of ship routes at sufficient resolution.
Mosaic blogs and twitter sites are providing no coverage.

This is similar to what the Fram experienced when frozen in much farther south
at 78º on 26 Oct 1893 (attached). Nansen blogged his expedition almost daily,
unlike Mosaic. Click on the lower left ship icon to see the daily updates at
about 9:00 UTC https://follow.mosaic-expedition.org

Meanwhile the CTD cabin and 1000m winch have been installed at Ocean City. The
water is 4000m deep at their location. We should not expect nrt water chemistry
as work-up of samples takes quite a while. They anticipate in the planning
documents to find the isotopic signature of Atlantic Waters at some depth.
However we might see temperature and salinity profiles since even an unmanned
buoy can send those.

It would be a good set-up for ice fishing were the bottle rack not blocking the
hole. Nansen ice-fished productively (despite the Fram carrying 6 years of
provisions) but found the hole froze over too quickly, jeopardizing gear. Their
scientific apparatus consisted of a weighted line lowered to measure fathoms to
the continental shelf.

We located the Lost Buoy of the AWI on the imagery of early October.
Significant ice failures occurred in its vicinity prior to hour of signal loss
but not precisely at its location. Its overall surroundings have stayed intact.

The Akademik Fedorov could be seen nearby on some dates; buoys were installed
from its helicopter. The AF shut down its GPS entirely, unlike the PS which has
merely dumbed it down to the minimum the German NWS will allow.

We would know more if the PS would just strap a cheap buoy and web cam on its
bow or stream ship radar hourly. They are posting far less information to the
internet than the average bird-feeder in the US, with less accuracy than a $150
personal weather station.

Miscellaneous news:

-- The European Space Agency seems to have killed off imaging of sea ice around
the Polarstern. The two satellites were instructed by parties unknown to no
longer send data to ground stations during three orbits that had been reporting
3 times daily for the last month (missing only 09.10.19).

We'll have to see what the mosaic-multisensor map series does tomorrow 01.11.19
when the Polarstern's route is updated for 31.10.19. Possibly they will switch
over to TerraSAR which is german-Proprietary. Possibly S1AB did in fact
continue imaging the ice but due to some glitch or new policy is not sharing it
yet with PolarView at UW.

The montage below illustrates the irregularities in S1AB contrast from day to
day. Three early morning orbits have been used; the Polarstern varies in where
it is moored relative to nadir. However individual scenes vary wildly in
contrast. When full resolution images are cropped to the immediate vicinity of
the PS, local contrast has to be optimized again.

There's a quick trick to match contrasts almost exactly across all 37 images
currently offered. This involves an invertible contrast contraction followed by
gamma adjustment in the Level tool of gimp.

Thirty days of Sentinel radar do not lie: the chosen floe has experienced
extensive regional deformation, cracking and local ridging, most recently
between the Polarstern and ice camp. Because the ship is a gigantic sail, it
experiences much stronger forces than flat ice around it. The original anchors
pulled out and six new ones had to be manufactured in the ship's machine shop.
It is a race between freezing ice slowly getting stronger and the next bout of
strong winds.

Another Chinese buoy has failed but 5 new ones have surfaced at IABP:

-- Smos and Smos/Smap are continuing to update daily at their usual Bremen
archives urls despite statements to the contrary from Smos/CryoSat2 expert
seaice.de at #343 on the freeze forum. The link provided in support goes

latest week of Smos/CryoSat2 is shown in the next post.

Maybe nobody gave techies at Bremen the news? Smos and Smos/Smap are at their
best right now because thin ice is very extensive (rather than just being on
the ice edge).

The image comparison below of Oct 30th to Oct 13th of ice around the Polarstern
shows why it broke away from its original mooring: extensive ice dynamics. This
shows two frames of the forthcoming 37 scene animation for the entire month of
October.

Because the Mosaic expedition :) has not made its original laser scan of ice
elevations in the Fortress area public in any meaningful way :(, only the S1AB
analog can be shown as an interactive 3D model (not supported by forum). This
digital elevation map assumes, somewhat wrongly, that all dark areas are flat
refrozen melt ponds with minimal freeboard and that all white areas are
roughened collisional ridging proportionately higher and whiter.

The green dot shows the Polarstern's position, as determined directly by its
reflected radar signal (as Mosaic  :) doesn't disclose :( ship GPS coordinates
as accurately as a cheap buoy). This 3D image too can be animated over the
entire month.

The combined Smos/Cryosat2 image below shows the average ice thickness in the
vicinity of the Polarstern to be 0.8m. No one has chased down details being
reported by the ice thickness buoys such as the 4 SIMB3 in terms of ice + snow
thickness and rates of growth at their current drift positions, even though the
company provides convenient open-source graphed time series.

A-Team has pointed out many missing or malfunctioning bits of the jigsaw that
are reducing the effectiveness of the work being done by the MOSAIC project.

It might be worth contacting the German Institute directly.  I did this when
level 3 GRACE-FO data for the ice sheets was slow in appearing. I got nothing
from the USA, but the professor in charge at the Helmholtz Centre, Potsda, GFZ
German Research Centre for Geosciences and one of his senior scientists were
extremely helpful.

After all, they can only say no (or ignore you).

Ascat now provides 3 images/day giving the opportunity for finer analysis of
movement, though the image times (unknown) don't appear to be evenly spread.
Here we are looking at the interferometry method described here which
highlights areas that move more than others with brighter colours, those moving
less tend towards grey.
The rough position of polarstern can be estimated from the ice edge and SZ, top
right.

Rather complicated how the polar images are synthesized from scatterometer
swaths. And hard to track down timestamps if indeed any are applicable. Key
issue though is the order. Is it A, then B, then C (or BAC, CAB, ACB, BCA,CBA)?
  The order and intervals seem to be CBA at 34 and 26 minutes separation:

 01:34  metopC  Svalbard ground station
 02:08  metopB  Svalbard ground station
 02:34  metopA  Svalbard ground station

The dates of coverage are:

  ASCATA 08-Apr-2009
  ASCATB 26-Nov-2012   
  ASCATC 08-Jun-2019

For the folks back home, those daily links are:

https://www.epochconverter.com/days/2019 (to convert day numbers to
day.month.year)

I looked at S!B interferometry about the Polarstern since there are 3 passes in
quick succession most mornings, for example Oct 30th:

S1B_EW_GRDM_1SDH_20191030T 03:11  12_2991_N_1.final.jpg
S1B_EW_GRDM_1SDH_20191030T 04:49  11_2203_N_1.final.jpg
S1B_EW_GRDM_1SDH_20191030T 06:27  16_846D_N_1.final.jpg

At first, I aligned the crops to the intersection of 86º˜and 128ºE which has a
red overlay on the jpg version. That reference frame proved to be so-so because
the ice moved too much pixels even during hourly intervals. (The motion was
uniformly northeast; there was no relative motion on this date)

The other reference frame involves aligning the bright white dot of the PS on
all three images, then doing the RGB from the three grayscales. That gave a
somewhat more attractive product at 3x zoom. The animation shows them in
perspective and also as their interferometric. The Polarstern is on the other
side of that white central hump.

One of three expected Nov 1st scene showed up belatedly on Polarview; staff is
looking into why Oct 31st scenes are not available to the public but accessible
to mosaic-multisensor.

    Mapping pan-Arctic landfast sea ice stability using Sentinel-1
    interferometry
    DO Dammann et al
    https://www.the-cryosphere.net/13/557/2019/ free full

    Arctic landfast sea ice has undergone substantial changes in recent
    decades, affecting ice stability and including potential impacts on ice
    travel by coastal populations and on industry ice roads. We present a novel
    approach for evaluating landfast sea ice stability on a pan-Arctic scale
    using Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR).

    Using Sentinel-1 images from spring 2017, we discriminate between
    bottomfast, stabilized, and nonstabilized landfast ice over the main
    marginal seas of the Arctic Ocean (Beaufort, Chukchi, East Siberian,
    Laptev, and Kara seas). This approach draws on the evaluation of relative
    changes in interferometric fringe patterns.

    This first comprehensive assessment of Arctic bottomfast sea ice extent has
    revealed that most of the bottomfast sea ice is situated around river
    mouths and coastal shallows. The Laptev and East Siberian seas dominate the
    aerial extent, covering roughly 4100 and 5100 km2, respectively. These seas
    also contain the largest extent of stabilized and nonstabilized landfast
    ice, but are subject to the largest uncertainties surrounding the mapping
    scheme.
    Even so, we demonstrate the potential for using InSAR for assessing the
    stability of landfast ice in several key regions around the Arctic,
    providing a new understanding of how stability may vary between regions.
    InSAR-derived stability may serve for strategic planning and tactical
    decision support for different uses of coastal ice.

    In a case study of the Nares Strait, we demonstrate that interferograms may
    reveal early-warning signals for the breakup of stationary sea ice.


The 'Uptempo' style of Mosaic buoy seems very straightforward and focused on a
narrow but important mission: now the upper Arctic Ocean is warming.

The question arises as to whether the Mosaic floe being so intensively studied
is typical or representative of the entire Arctic Ocean, or at least FYI in the
Laptev Sea. Right now, the Polarstern and all its instruments are missing a
large scale unusual event in the Laptev --  a flash freeze in which
accumulating nilas has been able to solidify in the near absence of mixing
winds.

The new thickness tool which combines SMOS ice thinness with Cryosat2
elevations (which comes out daily but as a rolling 7-day product) shows that
most of this new ice has inconsequential freeboard, making it doubtful that it
could currently support an insulating layer of dry snow. It may be a month or
more before it can serve as a haul-out area for seals and walruses. Should a
strong wind come up first, it might well revert to open water.

The Polarstern has currently set ice anchors in a very sheltered part of the
icepack. Whenever the pack rotates or moves sideways largely as a whole, no
significant internal ice stress results. Problems like ridging and opening
leads only arise when the wind stress and boundary conditions cause
differential forces on the ice.

A longer timescale view of the mosaic buoy network building up, day275-307
(today), no projection.
Dropouts (buoy fails to report or report is not recorded) show clearly using
delaunay.  A large number of buoys close to PS dropped out on day304.
Your browser does not support the video element.

Incredible floating effect! The Polarstern buoy array is such a neat idea for
extending outwards from the intensively studied Mosaic floe, too bad they
hardly ever work for more than a couple weeks. Maybe just stick an iphone
inside instead of all that no-good custom electronics?

Below is ice thickness according to the laser altimeter and soil moisture radar
ice thinness ... the palette is monotonically proportional to ice thickness
(though not linearly) so it displays more or less correctly in bump map view.
Because the .nc file is provided, the data can be redisplayed in polar
stereographic with one of the carefully designed linear palettes available in
Panoply.

However, it appears that the Cryo2Smos project has died or gone into
hibernation. Its daily archive has not been updated since the week ending Oct
30th. Only nine days of product were ever produced. Meanwhile, U Bremen
continues to update smos-smap and smos alone even though these were supposedly
taken away by U Hamburg/AWI.

Index of /sea_ice/product/cryosat2_smos/v202/nh/LATEST/

https://seaice.uni-bremen.de/data/smos/png/20191103_hvnorth_rfi_l1c.png

The surface plot (needs click) bears an uncanny resemblance to grayscale values
on plain vanilla Ascat, especially that extended pocket of thick white (low
salinity) mature MYI ice around the pole that has been there consistently on
Ascat for many many months.

It's not quite clear why the ice above the CAA is thiner (as historically that
has been the very thickest) but that is seen in multiple ice thickness
products. The Polarstern (white star) is currently situated in fairly thin ice,
surprisingly with thicker ice shown farther south on flanking meridians.

The ship has been moving rapidly east due to a persistent clockwise rotation of
the ice pack (as seen on OsiSaf: red star within green cruise bounding wedgie).
If this keeps up (it won't), the Polarstern would be home for christmas. The

A closer look at whoi itp102
Quote

    ITP102 was deployed on a 0.7 m thick ice floe in the Transpolar Drift on
    October 10, 2019 at 85° 7.9 N, 135° 34.1 E in collaboration with the
    Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate
    (MOSAiC) expedition from the Russian Research Vessel Federov. On the same
    icefloe, a Naval Postgraduate School Arctic Ocean Flux Buoy (AOFB) and
    Seasonal ice mass balance buoy were also installed. The ITP includes a
    second generation prototype MAVS current sensor operating on a pattern
    profiling schedule including 2 one-way profiles between 7 and 760 m depth
    each day and SBE-37 microcat fixed at 6 m depth.

The profile contours show small changes down to 50m since the start and the
microcat highlights temperature and salinity changes at 6m depth since day300.
Here we are also using macid's 3d R analysis to focus on temperature down to
50m showing a small rise of up to 0.16C at ~30m.

A rise in temperature and drop in salinity  at shallow depth could imply some
bottom melt but no doubt there are other reasons for these conditions in this
area.

No question, where the Polarstern originally moored was very dicey given thin
weak ice and strong winds (which have since dissipated). Temperatures have been
quite low but the thickening process is fairly slow.

The animation below follows this development on cryo2smos which is presumably
the best of both worlds in terms of satellite thickness determination. These
files are produced somewhat irregularly and require a week of Cryo2 data along
with daily Smos. The latter nine frames of the animation represent the Nov 2nd
differenced with the early ones back to Oct 22nd.

The Polarstern is currently at 85.9N 118.7E with winds at 32 km/hr from 50º
with a temperature of -23.1ºC at 07:00 UTC on 19-11-05. The clockwise rotation
of the ice pack has continued another day, resulting in more easterly longitude
while staying at the same distance from the pole.

Mosaic will not be sharing their ice thickness measurements any time soon so we
need to follow nearby buoys with the appropriate ice profiling instruments. At
some point, a 3DxT model will be produced of the 2.3 x3.5 km floe ice and snow
thickness with the help of the underwater ROV with upward looking sonar and
helicopter-borne downward laser scanning.

The three Sentinel-1B images at 02:22, 04:00, and 05:38 UTC this morning have
sufficient resolution to show significant motion of the Polarstern and the
Mosaic ice camp. The main image uses an earth-stationary coordinate system and
the inset one ship-stationary.

On the whole, the local ice pack is moving uniformly en bloc but some
non-threatening ice dynamics can be seen within the floe itself, though that
may be partly attributable to jumbled ice reflecting satellite beams with
slightly different orbits at slightly different efficiencies.
 
The Polarstern has appeared in 49 S1AB images since mooring to the floe
(through Nov 5th). The only omissions are Oct 9th and 31st. That offers many
opportunities to control variables, such as limiting analysis to images from a
particular orbit on a particular time on a particular instrument.

The 7th Mosaic-launched buoy officially died today, namely 300234068713430 CapO
CTD AWI.

Two Obuoys appear to have failed at roughly the same time, though quite
different locations. The pressure data for --519770 suggesting a trauma of some
kind on the19th oct. Click to run the animation of Obuoy charts provided by
meereisportal.de

Following up on the small temp/salinity changes shown by itp102 above. Here are
the obouys salinity at 20m depth (--169760 10m sensor has failed). Obuoy data
is collected every 10minutes, the files are around 4000 lines long today. The

    podcast by MOSAiC Leader Markus Rex. In German language though.

I clicked all over that page, couldn't get it to play. Is it same pre-trip
interview he gave whose transcript is online?

Finally an interesting photo!

First, note the new hawsers off the bow to the ice anchors mentioned earlier.
The triple is taut but the double pair in front is slack, suggesting slight ice
motion. If you set some lines slack and others taut, the wind will rip your
vessel loose successively.

The snow is not ankle deep, as befits the Arctic Ocean as a drier desert than
the Sahara. It looks very powdery though and thus is not entirely negligible as
insulation. Classical R values given in earlier post aren't the whole story
because the wind, eddies and turbulent air flow can't reach the ice to take
heat away. Snow flurries can be seen in the searchlight beam.

The freeboard can perhaps be estimated from the shovel blades. Note the ice
already trying to grow in from the sides. The big blocks, drilled around their
periphery and lifted out by the ship crane look to somewhat over a meter. The
photo is on the starboard side so thus this is Fortress ice, not flanking
fragile melt pond.  The hole is not locatable on the lidar altimeter map but it
doesn't matter since no scale was provided for that.

Some of factoids are puzzling. Are liquid volumes normally given in tonnes? Is
the Polarstern using filthy bunker fuel or something higher grade, given all
the wx towers and measurements. Helicopter fuel, that has to be separate. In
Greenland, that is brought in in bladders left on the ice, not pumped into the
hold.

Mosaic has absolutely no idea if they will ever get any closer to the North
Pole than they are now, much less if they will be within 200 km (>88ºN) for
60-90 days. Modeling of drift is completely delusional -- it amounts to a
seasonal weather forecast 350 days out and a whole lot more.

Each year now is effectively one-off; under rapid Arctic change it is 
statistically fallacious to think 12 years of unweighted previous drifts is
somehow random sampling from an underlying population whose properties can be
deduced and from which reliable inferences can be drawn. The Polarstern should
steer clear of the shoals of model pseudoscience.

    "All models are wrong but some are useful."

Yes, but how do we know in advance which ones are useful and which ones are
horribly misleading, dangerous, or even worse than wrong?

A-Team's calculation of 346km from Polarstern to the pole caused me to question
the automatic lat/lon kilometer axes on some of the buoy animations above. They
are based on a conversion of lat/lon to utm coordinates for the PlotSvalbard
mapping package. Many thanks to

   Mikko Vihtakari (2019). PlotSvalbard: PlotSvalbard - Plot
   research data from Svalbard on maps. R package version 0.8.5.
   https://github.com/MikkoVihtakari/PlotSvalbard

for an excellent resource.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system
Quote

    The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) is a system for assigning
    coordinates to locations on the surface of the Earth. Like the traditional
    method of latitude and longitude, it is a horizontal position
    representation, which means it ignores altitude and treats the earth as a
    perfect ellipsoid. However, it differs from global latitude/longitude in
    that it divides earth into 60 zones and projects each to the plane as a
    basis for its coordinates. Specifying a location means specifying the zone
    and the x, y coordinate in that plane. The projection from spheroid to a
    UTM zone is some parameterization of the transverse Mercator projection.
    The parameters vary by nation or region or mapping system.

    Most zones in UTM span 6 degrees of longitude, and each has a designated
    central meridian. The scale factor at the central meridian is specified to
    be 0.9996 of true scale for most UTM systems in use.


The image below from the PlotSvalbard documentation shows how the UTM distance
relates to the panarctic map used in the buoy animations based on the macid
code. I'll crop them off in future as they may be misleading.

Here we are showing the mosaic Sbuoys which measure snow-ice distance. The
first animation (click to run) shows the charts kindly provided by
meereisportal which appear to show 9 buoys with sensor1<20cm and one at over
1m.
What little I know about snow buoys comes from here
https://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,2906.msg233006.html#msg233006
Quote

    These seem to work by taking four sonar measurements from above, with
    calibration of actual snow at time of deployment. The sonar footprint is
    about 10 sq meters ... necessary because the snow pack is quite variable
    and subject to drift accumulations (or bare ice spots).


Maybe --083129 is in a hole or close to a ridge.
The second animation showing only sensor1 and drift.

When talking about fuel it's not unusual to talk about tonnes particularly for
ships, in this case Polarstern has 4 large Diesel engines, I doubt that they
will be using all of them and possibly only one for power on board,  More info

    What is IMO 2020? The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has ruled
    that from 1 January 2020, marine sector emissions in international waters
    be slashed. The marine sector will have to reduce sulphur emissions by over
    80% by switching to lower sulphur fuels.

Not seeing anything in the planning documents that indicates Mosaic intends to
comply. They don't think the Polarstern will be reachable even by icebreaker
during midwinter leg 2.

This morning, the Polarstern drifted 74 pixels east and 4 north or 73.1 pixels
at WGS84 41 meter per pixel resolution on a pair of S1B's orbitally angled at
49º and separated by 3.27 hours in timestamp with no indication of significant
shifting ice (final interferometric frame of lagrangian animation). This
pencils out to a speed of 22 km/day.

This measure of drift fits with the multi-day cw rotating icepack depicted by
OsiSaf today. Indeed, observed ice motion has finally become the classic
Beaufort arm coastal extension (not gyre) with furnished by ice above the CAA,
chaos in the ESAS/Laptev/Kara, constrained circumpolar drift (not trans)
centered on the Pole, with export out the Fram and SV-FJL gap.

The Polarstern is currently located at 85.9º,117.4º at 14:00 UTC which is 1298
vincenty km from the flux gate at the entrance to the Fram Strait where the
voyage is meant to end after 350 days. Per google earth, again in WGS84
ellipsoid geodesics, if the current velocity of ice drift keeps up (it won't),
the Polarstern will reach its destination in 59 days or on 04 Jan 2020.

(Humor alert: this simple-minded estimate is just to poke fun at Mosaic's
convoluted probabilistic drift route and arrival model.

That risk recedes but does not go to zero as the distance from the Polarstern
to the ice edge and open leads rapidly increases. Their staged response
involves flares, blasts from the ship's horn, remote guard stations, night
vision goggles, trip wires, bear prints in snow, shotguns for scientists,
mausers for on-duty guards and so on. The polar bears though are accomplished
ambush predators that can, like grizzly bears, outrun a wolf and tear open
flimsy shelters. So it is a tough call for the bridge either way, especially
with multiple isolated groups responding to a tripwire flare.

Some scientific Arctic expeditions also require a rescue swimmer to accompany
people walking away from the ship. It is not possible to self-rescue once bulky
clothes are wet and the timeframe is very short. The guard rope around the big
CTD hole (above) is unsatisfactory but then it is well-lit so close to the
ship. Otherwise, they have safe walking routes established and flagged.

Ridges and leads can form very suddenly but the effect is mostly stranding.
Falling through melt pond drains or thinning ice is an issue more for late
spring. It's never fully safe but then a motorway is even less safe.

I have not seen mention of a laser interferometer network that would provide
better guidance on regional internal ice stress and incipient deformation than
the virtual buoy GPS grid that uniq has been building. In past years, we have
seen massive leads open up overnight from the easternmost tip of Banks Island
(a repeat boundary condition) all the way to the New Siberians, ditto from
Morris Jesup. We calculated a lower bound on crack propagation of 45 km/hr.

This is more of a factor mid-winter when the ice is thick and more brittle from
the cold. Right now, the very extensive new ice that has formed between the
summer minimum and the Siberian shore is incapable of resisting ongoing
rotational shear. So it does not participate in that now but it will later as
it becomes rigid.

In the vast subject of differential equations, people have been talking for
centuries about complications introduced by abstract boundary conditions. In
the context of Arctic sea ice, that is meant literally: fixed land encircling
the basin and constraints it imposes on ice motion.

When an irresistible force (strong winds blowing against 7.1 m sq km of ice)
meets an immovable object (like Kotolny Island), something has to give. And
it's not the island. Up to a point, solid ice in the Laptev will inhibit the
kind of ice motion we have seen the last week. Beyond that, enormous brittle
fractures will become more frequent, putting equipment, people and the
Polarstern itself at some risk.

There's a golden opportunity right now because of the unusual persistence and
uniformity of ice pack rotation, to determine what (possibly non-unique)
arrangement of high and low pressure gives rise to it. Simplistic notions such
as the signature of the NAO pressure pattern are wholly inadequate to explain
what we are seeing; it will require a more synoptic view of winds and the
non-intuitive response of the ice to it that was already noticed on the voyage
of the Fram.

Conversely, any theory of ice pack rotation will have to explain cases when the
proposed pressure pattern does not result in rotation (or in ccw rotation).
Indeed, one of the stated goals of Mosaic is a predictive model 5 days out for
ice motion.

This is an instance of a truly massive body rotating nearly frictionlessly like
a spinning ice puck near the axis of a rapidly rotating sphere where the
coriolis and centrifugal forces are strong, so is different from familiar mid
latitude air cyclones and the like.

For example, if the earth were rotating clockwise as seen looking down at the
north pole instead of the 4 billion years of ccw, would TransPolar Drift
reverse direction? And what about the AMOC:

Polarstern "ship time" has finally been explained (below). The policy seems odd
... so many changes when they are trying to keep people on board on regular
meal and work schedules. Meanwhile  mosaic_multisensor tracking, onboard
meteorology and all the buoys are all on UTC?

The first icebreaker to meet the Polarstern for resupply and personnel exchange
will be the Kapitan Dranitsyn, a similarly-sized vessel at 129 × 26m that is
used for AARI research, passage escort and tourism currently in Murmansk. Its
call sign on sailwx is UCJP; we will be eagerly following its track through the
ice and inevitable damage during docking to the Fortress floe. However it may
shut off its GPS beacon like the Akademic Fedorov did or at least dumb down its
location to 1 dp.

AWI launched another Mosaic buoy nearby at 85.93 118.64 on Nov 6th, the 17th of
the ice-tethered IT type (IMEI -7705700). These just report position and
surface air temperature. There are currently 98 Mosaic buoys of which 8 have
already failed.

Today saw an uneventful continuation of the last few daysof quasi-rotational
motion, ie easterly drifting longitude at constant latitude (perspective
animation), though OsiSaf ice motion is starting to act up, possibly bringing
in shear in the next few days.

The real craziness was in very early October just before docking and then again
between Oct 18-19 when the southern part of the floe seriously rearranged
itself.

Currently the Polarstern is tied up at 85.9º,116.4º at 22:00 on Nov 7th, with
mild wind and cold temperatures. The farthest north the Mosaic floe has drifted
is 86.0º for 15 hours on Nov 5th. From where they are now, nearing the fast
lane of the circumpolar drift, it doesn't seem likely that they will ever get
closer to the Pole than they were on the 5th.

Following this on the latest OsiSaf amounts to drawing a circle from the pole
out to the current latitude of the ship on OsiSaf, then observing whether the
nearest gridded OsiSaf ice motion vector points inward relative to the tangent.
If not, the Polarstern is gaining longitude but losing latitude.

    Measuring along the 120º longitude between 85 and 86º gives 2712.58 pixels.
    On the WGS84 ellipsoid, this distance is  111682 meters.  Thus the scale on
    S1AB images here  is 41.17 meters per pixel or reciprocally 24.289 pixels
    per km.


Very nice!

Cropping down but not resizing (which omits an outlier buoy in upper right),
then drawing concentric circles in 5 km radial increments out to 40 km centered
on the moored Polarstern (white arrow), we see this class of buoys is somewhat
unevenly distributed about the base ship and not overtly co-located with ice
surface features resembling the Mosaic floe.

Three Sentinel images surfaced again today (lower left). These show moderate en
bloc motion over the scene uniq used, again equal parts zonally (eastward) and 
southerly meridional (motion diagonally away from the 86th parallel) that can't
be inferred from the 1 dp GPS data Mosaic provides to the public.

The green inset shows interferometry of the three times in the coordinate frame
of the Polarstern. The Fortress area again stands out as a dynamic area (pink
blob), as does a small lead (pink diagonal, upper right). The last 20 hours had
subdued winds and (considering it's the Arctic) moderate temperatures. Click to
see graphic at full resolution.

  85.9  115.9 19-11-08 20:00    7  360    -21.5 1017.3
  85.9  116.3 19-11-08 00:00    5   80    -26.2 1026.1

The collection of Sentinel radar overage of the Mosaic floe now consists of 57
times over 38 dates. Thanks to sailwx, a column for unix time was added; this
is needed to determine time intervals. The ship reports once an hour on the
hour whereas the Sentinel scenes are timestamped to intermediate minutes
appropriate to the orbit.

Using database columns, it is easy to build links to the nullschool GFS display
closest to the time of the Sentinel scene, showing the Polarstern's current
location as the green circle along with the data popup. The GFS comes in 3 hour
increments but if the url is not one of these UTC times, the link is resolved
automatically to the nearest GFS time.

What relation GFS modeled wind speed, wind direction pressure and temperatures
bear to actual precision on-site measurements remains to be determined. A big
part of the problem in determining how ice responds to the wind (eg, the
turning angle) has been poor quality, poor resolution data, often atypical
coastal.

The photogrammetry needed to determine the lat,lon of the Polarstern more
accurately than Mosaic is providing can be obtained by reading the position
directly off the ship's image off Sentinel-1AB imagery (very large files a very
long ways from the Pole origin of coordinates).

In terms of reducing error, the angle and distance from a convenient known
location such as 86º,120º can be measured very accurately (and consistently by
leaving tool end fixed while processing a whole stack of S1AB). Changing the
anchor or angle by one pixel provides a measure of robustness of final
calculated values.

The side-angle-side triangle computation provides arbitrary accuracy so no
error arises there. One remaining issue is that S1AB are rarely on the hour,
unlike buoys whose GPS positions are provided to Iridium databases to the high
accuracy necessary to measure deformation.

The daily OsiSaf picture provides the best single overview of Arctic Ocean sea
ice conditions; it shows sea ice concentration (open water, dodgy ice, thick
ice) as well as the 48-hr ice motion. Things are a bit crazy right now in the
Wrangel Island area with fragile ESS ice being pushed strongly away.

This doesn't immediately affect the Polarstern which had another day of smooth
sailing almost due south. However the changing wind pattern could seriously
wrench the ice pack around. Indeed on 2019-Nov-09 at 1900 UTC the ship is
zig-zagging a bit west at constant 85.8 latitude so something is up.

The OsiSaf/AMSR2 template template below is easy to use. Save, open in gimp,
activate the lat,lon overlay, paste in an entire Osisaf (it will automatically
register itself), and autocrop by the template to discard extraneous regions.

On a throwaway layer, draw in the longitude line using the amsr 1º guidelines
in Siberia. Here the trick is to continue on through the Pole until the
guidelines resume in Canada -- this avoids finding the Pole pixel. Then measure
the 85-86 distance and proportionately reduce for 1dp accuracy on latitude.
Finally put a star at the Polarstern's position from sailwx on the OsiSaf
layer. Discard amsr2 and throwaway layers, crop and resize fit for purpose.
Because the product is usually saved as png, the xcf format of gimp will remain
unchanged as a template for the future,

    south?

Right. It's confusing but all directions are south from the North Pole, even
'up' which we are accustomed to think of as north on maps. Today the Polarstern
held its latitude (southness) at 85.8º but slipped back 0.4º to larger
longitude instead of drifting towards the 0º longitude Fram as intended.

Polar coordinates are the natural choice because physics associated with
rotation through the earth's axis then has a simpler description. Ditto using
the sun as the center for the solar system vs epicycles. All has to do with
conservation of angular momentum. Problem is, pixels on device screens are
square as in x,y. Money cannot buy a monitor with r,θ wedgie pixels.

Compounding the confusion is the Polarstern voted to have north up, all the
time, on all maps. So two buoys, 50 km apart, are shown with different norths.
No thanks. There is a reason why 'Greenland down' is used in almost all
satellite products: so you can overlay them without quality-destructive
fractional rotations. Not using UTC for ship time? Another head-scratcher.

The easiest way to follow Polarstern movement is glance at the hourly lat,lon
at the Polarstern's weather feed (which is mounted on a mast on the bridge):

Here is some further detail on the Polarstern and ambient ice dynamics in the
Mosaic project area. Winds have been mild keeping stress on the ice pack
minimal but that is due to change by noon tomorrow if GFS can be believed.

The peak sustained winds of 55 km/hr corresponds to about 15 m/s in the units
used by AWI above. So that is about 3x the average wind speed of the recent
weeks but in terms of force on the ice, more like the cube or ~27x for wind
power density (2.4 kw/m^2 maximum).

The Polarstern, the world's fanciest buoy, is also a gigantic sail. While leads
have surely frozen over in the area and ice on the port side is much colder
than at the Oct 5th mooring, it is also more brittle but not yet much
thickened.

Very little of the floe actually has equipment such as wx towers set up on it,
though power and data lines run out to the three main deployment areas. The
very fanciest ARM equipment stays in six containers on the bow of the ship and
makes its measurements from there.

However, the near-disaster on Oct 18-19 shows that the Mosaic floe is already
preconditioned to further fracturing as nearby massive fissures freeze up but
never really reach full strength again.

It's not clear what it even means to 'follow the evolution of a single floe for
a year" when the Mosaic floe has already undergone multiple significant
demonstrable macro rearrangements not 10% into the cruise, unrelated to
classical ice thermodynamic issues such as ocean-ice-air heat transfer they
came to study.

While people onboard report constant noise from grinding ice, it may not be
possible in the dark to sense relatively slow deformations like those seen in
consecutive Sentinel scenes. The perspective and nadir views are 3x
enlargements so about 14 meters per pixel over 3 hours 16 minutes of timestamp
separation today. Thus changes of a few pixels off the Fortress area, if it
happens at a steady rate rather than abruptly, are at tortoise speed.

Technical note: the nullschool GFS model below picks up the baton from the most
recent OsiSaf in 3 hour increments and carries it forward another 100 hours.
These are easily made by stepping the Polarstern position-aware url below with
keystroke k, then taking whole window screenshots to build registered layers in
gimp. The numerical values are then cropped out from image duplicates and
layered over the tiled-up wind graphic after adjusting text height and
expanding canvas width to match the main tile size.

Perhaps that is more ridging close to the polarstern.

South? It confused me too. Not happy with the blurred buoy positions on post #
219 above here is a more accurate version using a larger buoy image and one
rotation. Comparing the pentangle of buoys on the 86N line with the post above
they do move almost due south. Confusing.
This image should include all the meereis mosaic buoys in the small area shown
that are listed here which reported at 0400 UTC today. Lat/Lon positions are
~8mins earlier than the image. (click for full resolution)

south?
Right. It's confusing but all directions are south from the North Pole, even
'up' which we are accustomed to think of as north on maps. Today the Polarstern
held its latitude (southness) at 85.8º but slipped back 0.4º on longitude
instead of drifting towards the 0º longitude Fram as intended.

So latitude stayed at 85.8º so it moved neither N or S, but its longitude
increased so to my mind that means they're drifting E?

Right. They got as far north as 86.0º. At midnight, the Polarstern is currently
at 85.9  116.3 on 19-11-11 at 00:00 UTC. They got as far east as 135.8. lt's
all tabulated for you in the csv attached above for the Sentinel image catalog
or in nrt at the url above.

It looks from uniq's map that one of the buoys is actually on the Mosaic floe
itself, on the northwest corner. Since it was closest to the Polarstern on Nov
8th, it is closest to the Polarstern now since everything is moving in lock
step.

So copying out the current IABP positions of all buoys in the Arctic Ocean
right now and grepping down to the 92 active Mosaic ones (just replace 'cr
Moraic' by 'tab Mosaic' and sort on column G), then inserting the current PS
lat, lon and sorting on lat, then lon the picture below emerges for buoy names
closest to the ship. Here we need the PS position to more dp, as described a
few posts above.

Wondering if there is a workflow for that. Thanks for the hint anyway, A-Team.

In other news, according to the podcast, there is a fish cam! Anyone ever saw

    fish cam? bridge radar? gps? helmholtz? cruise report? ms piggy? ROV ice
    bottom?

I've not even seen a still. Can you not wait until 2023 when Pangea is
unblocked and papers first start appearing? Mosaic has very restrictive
top-down control of  ( :) ) information, trickle-down. Just because you paid
100% of expedition costs with your taxes doesn't give you any right to know
what they are doing.

Another AWI snow buoy was pronounced dead this morning by IABP, the 8th such
announcement that went unannounced. This one was defective from the day of
installment, hardly ever reported air or snow temperatures but worked for 26
days as a GPS buoy.

They should really let the buoys start reporting to Iridium on shipboard to see
if the sensors are working rather than wasting helicopter resources deploying.
Or maybe test them back in Germany? The IABP record shows they did neither.

This didn't start with Mosaic -- the Arctic buoy program has always been a
joke. A thousand second-hand iPhones dropped from a plane could do better
tracking ice.

The Polarstern continues to drift back and forth, up and down. From the 3
Sentinels this morning, the ship can be seen moving north along the 116.4º
meridian. Displacements are unremarkable: at 126.5 pxls between the 03:11 and
06:25 which pencils out to 2.8 km in 3 hrs 14 minutes or 20.8 km per day.

Since the last S1B, the ship has moved 0.2º east while holding the same
latitude 85.9. Winds predicted by GFS seem to be picking up at the ship: they
are at 14 m/s now and expected to reach 15.3 m/s or 55 km/hr.

This is close to the worst winds the ship has experienced so far, back on Oct
8th winds reached 60.7 km/hr according to sailwx. The attached graphic shows
the wind speed distribution; the attached csv has columns the speeds in km/hr,
m/s and knots. These October winds were being called gale force at the time,
fair enough:

2019-Oct-08 0600   85.0   136.0   56.9
2019-Oct-08 0500   85.0   136.0   56.9

    A gale force wind can be defined as a sustained strong wind, registering
    between 7-10 on the Beaufort Scale, which indicates wind speeds of 50 - 102
    km/h


It's not entirely clear at what height above the ice these winds are measured
and modeled. Usually wx tries to get clear of surface topography but that is
exactly where wind stress is applied to the ice. The Polarstern has lost 0.4º
of longitude in the last 14 hours; this is interesting/confusing because it
suggests a wind coming from 180º (measured at the ship) blows the ice due
east.T

The 14 m/s is just barely over 50 km/hr so a few more hrs will bring them into
a sustained gale force stress regime. GFS today shows the winds peaking at 54
km/hr at 03:00 UTC from 205º on the 12th and not abating until 09:00 tomorrow.
The S1B's will cover the ice response quite well.

  85.9  116.7 19-11-11 15:00   16  180
  85.9  116.7 19-11-11 14:00   14  180
  85.9  116.6 19-11-11 13:00   14  180
  85.9  116.6 19-11-11 12:00   13  180 [GFS predicted this perfectly: 13.9 m/s
175º, see above]
  85.9  116.6 19-11-11 11:00   13  180
  85.9  116.5 19-11-11 10:00   11  170
  85.9  116.5 19-11-11 09:00   11  170
  85.9  116.5 19-11-11 08:00   10  170 
  85.9  116.5 19-11-11 06:00   11  170   S1B 06:27
  85.9  116.4 19-11-11 05:00   10  160
  85.9  116.4 19-11-11 04:00    8  160   S1B 04:49
  85.9  116.4 19-11-11 03:00    9  160   S1B 03:11
  85.9  116.4 19-11-11 02:00    9  180
  85.9  116.3 19-11-11 00:00    7  190

The offset is mildly confusing: the 120º is at 75.00 on Sentinel images
according to gimp and imageJ angle tools as appropriate to 'Greenland down'. So
the offset is 45º, meaning the 116.4 should be drawn at 71.40º towards the pole
which is ten thousand pixels off the image.

No question, they are putting in long hard work days on the ship. However there
is large support team onshore including many idle grad students, post docs and
senior ice researchers (who mostly departed on the AF because lab techs stay on
to maintain instruments).

Some of what we do hear strains credulity: stable ice dynamics (the satellite
is wrong), launching a giant weather balloon in gale force winds (the ship
weather station is wrong) and so on.

The top priority for us is simply hourly GPS position and bearing data for the
Polarstern. As measured, to 4-5 dp and tenths of a degree. Nobody goes to sea
without this basic technology.
 
In my view, sea ice forums are not perceived as a credible threat. It is rather
scientists from N-ICE2015 who pose the real danger. They would know exactly
what to do with the data if there were any: process and submit journal papers,
thus scooping Mosaic players before they could even get their toes thawed out.
That would be a terrible tragedy that dwarfs important climate change 
information that might emerge sooner. That's the mind-set behind all the
secrecy.

Putting academic games aside, what will tomorrow morning's satellite show? The
ice along the Polarstern's meridian is experiencing high but fairly uniform
wind stress that is not conducive to dangerous shearing. However to the east
and west of its latitude, the wind is minimal. This suggests strong tensile
forces to the east (big leads opening) and strong compressive forces to the
west (ridging, over-rafting).

The current anti-cyclone, like so many of them, is not rotating about the
geographic north pole but rather the pole of inaccessibility, the reason being
less oppressive boundary conditions. Starting from the Polarstern's current
position, it is easy to make make wind stress transects meridionally, zonally,
or radially wrt the anti-cyclone center

The first of these shows a moderate gradient along air flowlines; the second
which is similar to radial shows almost no wind gradient in direction or speed.
Thus locally, ice dynamics may be fairly minimal in the immediate vicinity of
the Polarstern. (However effects can propagate long distances in brittle sea
ice.)

Nice way of tracking Polarstern!

The first image below brings the next frame of the time series, the 00:42 of
the 12th, into Sentinel position which involves a cw rotation of 105º to bring
the 130th meridian into vertical position. That is needed to extend the canvas
downward so that the 86º latitude circle can be drawn. (RAMMB shows the 87.5;
two latitudes must be included for the radial scale to be determined
accurately.)

The image shows the Polarstern position data from sailwx and ship meteo for
00:00 and 01:00 UTC. The agreement is ok with the lights of the ship show it to
be at 85.95º, 117.37º (=45.00 + 72.37 measured) versus the rounded off 86.0,
117.2 of the low accuracy GPS.

It appears that no Sentinel coverage will be provided following the sustained
gale force winds; processing delays at PolarView happen but are not common. It
is not possible to see down to the ice on the Rammb which is working at 700nm
in the far red part of the visible spectrum. ImageJ allows color to be set by
wavelength; a putative 700 nm square is included.

The nearest Sentinel for Nov 12th is well to the west of the Polarstern and is
shown below only to illustrate the extensive fracturing that can occur in
Arctic sea ice. The inset shows the width of an 1100 km feature (at the 41m/pxl
scale of the inset) can exceed a kilometer.

5 mosaic buoys on iabp have files of incorrect length today, 3 of them were in
the group used recently for the deformation test. In particular, 7509680 was a
nice outlier to the south east for showing distance change. It's been replaced
with 6344810 a little closer in.
This animation updates the one previously upthread using tighter lat/lon and a
smaller z axis, day311-316(today). As the ice thickens there is likely to be
less movement.

I think some of the movement shown using this method is due to a small distance
change causing the delaunay triangulation to connect the buoys in a different
order which will give an inaccurate, possibly meaningless, distance change in
some of the central points. Using less buoys would reduce that possibility, as
would diving deeper into the code. So, probably less buoys ;)
or less animations :)  Removed

This picks up at 0:42Z on the 12th.  There's a 16 hour jump at the beginning
due to no imagery available.

The first three images show what happened in the vicinity of the Polarstern
during the gale (defined as sustained winds over 50 km/hr) that peaked at 16:00
UTC on 11 Nov 19. Some very large leads opened to the east and widened again
overnight but have not impacted the Mosaic experimental area too much at this
point.

The first gif has cut-outs on the Nov 11th to allow the 13th and 14th to show
throught. The Polarstern is in the lower right corner of the second time
series.

Three S1AB scene were taken on the 11th, none on the 12th, only a rare S1A on
the 13th and a single S1B on the 14th. It is difficult to understand priorities
at ESA/Copernicus. Only scenes in the sensor mode EW_GRDM_1SDH will appear on
PolarView; the Copernicus portal lacks polar ordering views.

The omission on the 12th is only the 4th gap in coverage since Oct 1st during
which 66 scenes have been provided. The only other tools we have are RAMMB as
above, Band 31-night on Terra and Band 15 VIIRS on Suomi but these are usually
plagued by cloud cover.

Heat release from the ocean to the air as visualized in passive infrared bands
will only correspond approximately to active S1AB radar which is imaging
something entirely different, beam return as inhibited by dielectric (salinity)
but enhanced by surface roughness. The black and white stars correspond to the
Polarstern's coordinates on this date.

More buoys are failing to report. The number soared to 15 as a batch of Chinese
TUT buoys went offline very close to the same time for unknown reasons. These
leaves 84 still working though some of those report with inexplicable and
growing delays. At this rate, not a single Mosaic buoy out of a hundred will
survive past 20 May 2020. These buoys are very important in extending the
project's reach beyond the immediate drift of the Polarstern.

The current location is at a record northerly latitude (not quite to Nansen's
86.22 but farther than the Fram's 85.92) but the drift is again away from
Svalbard. Nothing resembling the weather pattern characteristic of transpolar
drift has set up yet per OsiSaf.

Decent Suomi band 15 on Nov 13th, click to enlarge. The Polarstern is just a
bit under the clouds. They still have no more than a good dusting of snow.

Not clear why PS complains so much about the cold when it is far more pleasant
than Chicago at 41.9º N (where I had a pre-dawn Sunday paper route as a kid).

The ice pack fracturing has settled down but another gale force event is in the
works for GFS tomorrow. The animation below takes a look ice dynamics around
the Polarstern for the last 45 days, every 5th day.

Because the longitude varies quite a bit, the images were rotated back to the
original mooring latitude according to the table below, then translated (moved
x,y) so that the white dots of the Polarstern emitter came into register. This
has the effect of removing bulk drift to leave regional ice dynamics about the
ship.

Note a fair number of local features have drifted along with the Polarstern.
However significant departures from rigid body motion occur and make icepack
twist about more like a rubber sheet than the brittle material it is.

The inset represents a 2.5x enlargement about the ship. While there is a fair
amount of daily flection, the largest change was on the 18th when the upper
smooth dark patch (south side of the Mosaic floe) slid east about 725 meters in
a process still continuing the last two days.

Right. Though tomorrow's winds could bring serious troubles because of ice
divergence near the Polarstern's location. The ship will be losing latitude the
next 3 days as ice moves at ~30º angle to the right of the wind, so towards the
NSI/Laptev/Kara/SZ.

This is a big improvement over the happy face absurdities from the PR dept back
on shore. I am not familiar with the term Presseisrücken, perhaps what we are
calling ice dynamics induced by pressure from ice movement but maybe it is a
technical term for pressure ridges.

Quote

    "There is no direct telephone line in this wasteland, so we wrote our
    questions to Professor Markus Rex, head of the MOSAiC expedition, and he
    sent us back his answers. So the interview you hear now is retrospective.

    Nevertheless, we do our work on a very dynamic ice surface. It constantly
    breaks up at various points; ice pressure causes high press pressures. This
    is not a stable, safe surface, and many teams work out on the ice every
    day.

    Trotzdem, wir machen unsere Arbeiten auf einer sehr dynamischen
    Eisoberfläche. Die reißt ständig an verschiedenen Stellen auf, es bilden
    sich durch Eisdrucke hohe Presseisrücken.

    In the weeks that followed, we were actually plagued by many difficulties.
    The ice is just unstable. It is torn up several times in the thin areas of
    this floe. We also had to recover equipment from the water. Pressure ridges
    have cut and spilled our fluid lines.

    [[Das Eis ist eben instabil. Es ist in den dünnen Bereichen dieser Scholle
    mehrfach aufgerissen. Wir mussten bereits auch Ausrüstungsgegenstände aus
    dem Wasser wieder bergen. Presseisrücken haben unsere Stromlinien
    durchschnitten und verschüttet.]]

    You can only look for polar bears in the beam of the ship's searchlights
    and use the thermal imaging device we use on the bridge to scans the
    environment for polar bears, but that's also a problem, which also throws
    our work back again and again

    ... in the area of ​​our searchlights from the ship or, if we have
    moonlight, we also see this bizarre, extraterrestrial ice landscape around
    us, ice sculptures that have unfolded through the forces of ice pressure
    and wind, interspersed with large flat areas, planes, in between where it
    is usually dark when the moon shimmers over, black areas, that's what we
    see up here out of my window. Elongated press ridges stretch several meters
    high, in which the ice crumbles and crumbles under these enormous forces
    that we sometimes have here, forming these formations. This looks really
    alien if I look out the window, at least if you see anything at all."


Stefan Hendricks, a geophysicist at AWI, put up another interesting comment
today to the effect they flew around "investigating" various (failed?) buoys,
plus updated their surface topography map along with ice surface temperature.

Follow_Mosaic seems not to known where the Polarstern has been nor where it is
now nor where it is going next. The ship about to hit some serious divergence
in the wind vector field which will affect the ice similarly.

Like! (like bigger dots, longer tails)

Not sure what you mean by Pbuoys. These?

Due to unfortunate lack of coding skills I hack macid's code for the Pbuoy
animations which use the meereis csv format here
All Pbuoy data is calculated but some is out of range of the animation above.
The times vary but most are valid to 15/11 0300
The followmosaic PS location (to 2 decimal places) from an unknown time is
added as a rough guide.
Hopefully they will provide a time with the location at some point.

There's a static array with the buoy names in the code that be quickly edited
in case you want to remove some odd ones or add new, I tested with P & S Type
buoys for csv format handling, both do drift speed I think.

I think the most accurate location of the PS you can get by putting a dot
between the closest buoys..

*edit: checking the code, line 31 makes it only download P types, have to hack
it to do others yep

Good suggestion. Seemed like one of the buoys was actually fixed on the corner
of the selected floe. Still, the floe is ~3000 m whereas 4 dp GPS is ~11 m.

A third Sentinel-1AB came in this morning for yesterday Nov 15th. It shows what
appears to be a white pressure ridge appearing between 04:16 and 05:54 right
along the axis of the Polarstern. To the west (right) a long dark lead has
opened further and shifted towards the Mosaic floe.

Other instabilities can also be seen but we await today's S1AB for confirmation
and further developments over the multi-day course of the cyclone which will be
massively disruptive for the Mosaic floe and the equipment deployed on it.
PolarView is not processing images so far today, perhaps because it is early on
the weekend.

The ship added another two tenths of a longitude degree just in the last hour
from gale force winds. They originally moored at 85.1, 133.8 on Oct 5th.

Imagine...

So you've volunteered and lobbied like mad to be on the project - what an
opportunity for a young scientist!

You've got a bit of Arctic experience - in the summer's 24 hour daylight.

But today,
- 2 months of darkness is getting to you,
- it's about -7 celsius outside, + windchill from 50 kmh wind,
- the ship is creaking and groaning,
- the ice is creaking, groaning, grinding, crack! a new lead.

The boss needs you to go on the floe to rescue some gear before it heads 4,000
metres down.
The polar guards have said the bears are a bit active today - lots of holes in
the ice means a better chance of getting a seal.

Life is wonderful.

Stuff that for a game of soldiers.

Thanks macid. I download all the meereis buoys separately and copy the ones I
want to see into the work file. My biggest problem is making a ~80buoy iabp
animation work. The files and dates are a different format. I think/hope I'm
doing ok tinkering with the meereis csv's.

As we have some significant movement at the moment here are the  meereis Pbuoys
from nov14-16 04:30, though not all buoy data may be collected up to that time.
The animation has 54 frames, which should be 1/hr though looking at the
'brownian motion' I suspect some averaging over time for the buoys that report
every 10mins or lack of pixels for an accurate representation. Running a larger
scale animation may determine which it is.
I've left the red PS dot in from yesterday's position for fun ;) at 86.11N

The Mosaic floe experienced only moderate ice dynamics during the record winds
of Nov 16th (going by the only data of the 15th and 17th); we don't know what
effect if any this had on equipment set up at the Ice Camp. Another WHOI buoy
is gone; again we lack a causal attribution. Tomorrow will bring further
challenging conditions with strong divergent winds.

One surprise initially was the thinness of the ice; neither satellites nor
models prepared them for the fragility and thinness of the ice at the selected
floe. Next, the mechanical strength of the ice (which cannot be measured
remotely) was less than what they needed to plow logistics runways with the
Piston Bullys -- that seems unthinkable even now.

Reporters onboard the AF noted a layer of dirty ice sloughing off the bottom of
overturned floes; the trip leader spoke yesterday of porous immature ice. How
should these be reported at Piomas, how do they count towards Cryosat2
freeboard or SMOS ice thinness? It doesn't work very well to idealize ice from
far away because it has become quite heterogenous and very complex close up.

The third surprise has been atypical winds. There is no indication of when
trans- or circumpolar winds will set up -- indeed the Fram has been running in
reverse. That could change, but at this rate the Polarstern won't get very far
on its expected drift. Even if it resumed, the ship won't get near the pole
because an enormous impenetrable block of thick MYI ice has occupied that
region for close to a year. What would move that out of the way?

It's not really clear how to compare ice dynamics year on year but leads,
ridging and deformation may be worse than the expedition had anticipated, again
because of seemingly deteriorating ice capacity for resisting wind stress.

I wonder how the guy wires are engineered on the two tall meteo towers.
Presumably with very stout springs to take up relative ice motion, yet
elasticity would leave the tower swaying in the strongest winds of the trip,
21m/s (75.6 km/hr or 47 mph) on Nov 16th. Recall early on the long crack with
legs of the first tower a couple of meters away from doing the splits.

  86.1  122.2 19-11-16 20:00   16  300     -5.2
  86.1  122.1 19-11-16 19:00   16  290     -5.0   994.4

A keeper! These are fascinating to watch. Below the whole trajectory of each
buoy is shown (gimp 'stack average' + level contrast tools; often used to set
minimal crop boundaries that don't miss anything).

The Polarstern will be in a very curious situation tomorrow at 15:00 utc: low
wind locally but situated in an 84º turn in much higher wind stress which will
result (?) in a giant lead opening along the blue band.

That looks like a slowly failing GPS, no? First, you see a delay in updating

P101 went bad a month ago, 2019-10-19 19:24:00, accelerometer variance reports
a whopping 7076 mystery units for the last regular report in. Accelerometers
are supposed to report x y and z values but I'll imagine they're combining the
outputs into a sum of accelerations on all axes, indicating a tumbling of sorts
when spiking.

Polar bear ran off with it? Fell into a widening lead? Latter seems more
likely, graph attached. curious wave action going on before as well. heavy
winds, massive drift may have played a role in it's demise.

After that quiet for 8 days, since then intermittent reports of ~half days,
indicating poor satellite reception, which would also account for the erratic
movement. GPS accuracy drops quickly when you get down to just a few sats in
view.

"How not to get stuck in the Arctic sea ice"
Akademik Fedorov, a Russian supply vessel to Polarstern is part of Mosaic. Now
playing a difficult game in the high Arctic: trying to stay in the thickening
winter sea ice without getting stuck.
Long read.

    looks like a slowly failing GPS, no? First, you see a delay in updating and
    then a failure, pinpointing it to a location in the past. GPS accuracy
    drops quickly when you get down to just a few sats in view

The cadillacs among buoys, the four Mosaic-deployed SIMB3 from Dartmouth, have
columns reporting the number of GPS satellites in range, how good an Iridium
signal they are getting and how often the buoy calls again if it doesn't get
through at first. (They also have pitch, roll and heading but those are not
currently activated.)

On average, there are 8.7 GPS satellites within range and these buoys are
reporting to phenomenal accuracy, eg 85.739648, 121.329032, which is rounded
off to one less decimal by IABP in tracking the 100 buoys of Mosaic.

On land, GPS accuracy greatly benefits from a local tower that supplements
satellites that might not have the greatest positions. The Polarstern is moving
around too much (drift, jostle, internal wave recoil) for its mast to serve as
a fixed local base (see motion below for Nov 18th and 19th).

I don't believe any of the buoys carry radar reflectors or emitters that would
allow them to be positioned directly on Sentinel-1AB imagery which is about 41m
at PolarView at 85-86º. So there is no way of independently checking reported
accuracy even at that level.

source: SIMB3_387850.csv
#gpsSats   iridium_signal   iridium_retries
8.7   4.4   0 averaged over 259 entries

They did have a battery failure on 08 Nov 191/8/19 on the L1 at the remote
atmospheric flux station. This turned out to be a defective fuel cell that was
no longer charging the batteries. They could not get out there on the
helicopter to replace it because of low clouds. This would not be applicable to
buoy battery failure: no fuel cells. Ditto polar bears chewing on deployed
cables: no cables. Ditto cracks propagating under the foot of the 'swingset'
supporting downward looking radiation instruments: no supporting platform for
buoys.

Part of their current polar bear problem may be attributable to Mosaic
passengers on the Akademik Fedorov feeding them scraps of meat to take selfies.

The Polarstern, contrary to what we have been repeatedly told, has had 
phenomenal internet service (100 Mbps) the entire way including at its farthest
north location, thanks to a new pair of satellites. The PS does not use much
Iridium, too expensive for limited bandwidth.

    Kepler provides 120 Mbps uplink to Arctic via satellite broadband
    by Bevin Fletcher | Nov 8, 2019 11:32am
    https://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/
    kepler-delivers-120-mbps-uplink-to-arctic-via-satellite-broadband

    Toronto-based Kepler Communications said that it demonstrated data rates of
    38 Mbps downlink and 120 Mbps uplink aboard the German icebreaker
    Polarstern to a 2.4m Ku-band Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT). The ship
    is home to the international MOSAiC expedition that involves hundreds of
    scientists and operations crews examining the effects of climate change on
    the Arctic.

    Kepler is providing high-bandwidth satellite connectivity from low-Earth
    orbit (LEO) to help the team share large data files between the vessel and
    shore. Kepler’s satellites are placed around 575 km from Earth, so the
    closer location helps significantly reduce latency compared to
    geostationary (GEO) satellites that are 35,000 km from Earth.

    “Our Global Data Service provides a cost-effective means to transfer large
    data volumes that will be gathered over the course of MOSAiC,” said Mina
    Mitry, CEO at Kepler, in statement. “Rather than only storing data locally
    and analyzing once physical storage can be sent back with supply vessels,
    we are giving scientists the ability to continuously transfer test and
    housekeeping data sets. When its two polar-orbiting satellites pass over
    the vessel, Kepler is providing 100-times higher data speeds than would
    otherwise be possible”

    Markus Rex said “Kepler's new Global Data Service now enables us to send
    back bulk data, including key data files for monitoring the status of
    instruments together with experts at home. This will contribute to the
    success of MOSAiC."

The image below locates the four SIMB3 surface mass balance buoys relative to
the Polarstern on Nov 19th. This worked out because S1B took an image at 07:00
at which time all four buoys reported with an exactly matching timestamp. Not
all buoys report all the time when they should (see attached databases of
quadruples and triples).

The angles and lengths of the position arrows were provided by the
side-angle-side tool (https://www.triangle-calculator.com/?what=sas) given that
86º latitude is 10843.4 pixels from the pole and the 120º longitude is at a 75º
angle on Sentinel images served by PolarView.

There is plenty of opportunity for confusion here but when it is all sorted out
and their locations and properties plotted over time with variable values such
as ice thickness interpolated within the triangles by kriging, it could be of
interest. The Polarstern is measuring many of the same things and sending the
data to shore with their high bandwidth internet but is not sharing it until
2023.

Ice movement as predicted above from the GFS-envisioned cyclone resulted in
cracks, leads and ridging -- some of them repeats -- and considerable agitation
of the whole Mosaic floe Ice Camp as seen on Sentinel despite pushing up
against its resolution.

There are quite a few impacts from the Polarstern having to run its generator
engines all the time ... twitter scrapes from reporters on the AF and PS and a
Science commentary piece 0https://tinyurl.com/yjey6av4).

The bottom line is that it is hard to do large scale science safely and
sustainably at such a remote pristine location without observer impacts. But
what is the alternative: crappy models, more satellites lacking sufficient
resolution, more buoys that break down in the first month, more imagery that
cannot be interpreted, no real understanding of ocean-ice-atmosphere couplings
or the physics behind Arctic amplification?

How do the Polarstern's impacts stack up relative to commercial shipping, say
of anthracite coal being dug out of a Siberian national park today and shipped
to China and India?
 
"The next day they told us not to throw meat over the side again to the polar
bears ... The data cables would later become chew toys for the polar bears."

"I've wondered sometimes whether the #Polarstern and #AkademikFedorov could
have been 1K cooler, a little less brightly lit? It felt like a lot of the heat
was coming from the engines or the incinerator. But it was definitely super
warm on board. Don't know about the details of the heating system."

"The Polarstern can't be shut down completely, because it must serve as the
expedition's power plant, command center, and hotel—which some might call a
five-star. There is a dining room that serves mouthwatering cakes every
afternoon at tea time, a sauna, a swimming pool, a gym, a bar, and even small
shops where you can buy sweets, tobacco, and alcohol. Although the ship is
passively drifting with the ice, it will guzzle 15 tons of diesel fuel per day
."

"Aboard the Polarstern at MOSAiC's start, I looked forward to seeing the North
Star twinkle close to the top of the sky. But the ship floods the ice with
light to enable the researchers to work safely and efficiently, creating a
powerful glow that blots out the sky. I did not see a single star during my 2
weeks aboard."

The solid layer of blue ice in between snow on top and mushy rotten ice below,
has rarely made it past the 50 cm gradation on the measuring stick. The new
layer at the top is the firm ice that can support weight. The older rotten ice
below is unreliable, although there is a question about whether a thicker layer
of it helps or hinders refreezing during winter.

"For AWI biologist Allison Fong, the glow is a problem. She wants to better
understand how microbial plant life survives in the Arctic winter, when there
is no sunlight for months on end, but she can't study samples that have been
exposed to artificial light. So, once a week she plans to drive a snowmobile to
what she calls the "dark zone" hidden behind a fortress of small ridges of snow
and ice some 500 meters from the ship. There, researchers will don red
headlamps (red light doesn't affect most organisms) and collect ice cores that
they will analyze back at the ship."

"Oceanographers, meanwhile, are dealing with the heat, turbulence, and
wastewater produced by the Polarstern. "At the main site around the ship,
there's sort of a dead zone" for collecting data, says Tim Stanton, an
oceanographer at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. To
avoid the issue, he and others have deployed a handful of autonomous
instruments, which sit on the ice or float in holes, far from the ship."

"The expedition's own noises, meanwhile, have forced atmospheric scientists to
build special defenses. At a site called "Met City" a half-kilometer from the
ship, a barrier nearly as tall as a person shelters an instrument that uses
pulses of sound to measure the density of air, and thus gain insight into the
structure of the atmosphere. The barrier is designed to deaden any artificial
noise that might rumble across the seascape, such as blasts of the ship's horn
and the whine of snowmobiles and nearby electronics"

"Then there is the Polarstern's sooty exhaust—a huge problem for the many
MOSAiC scientists studying the Arctic's unusually clean air. The researchers
want to better understand the sources and fates of aerosols—tiny particles
suspended in the atmosphere—that contribute to the formation of small ice
crystals within clouds. The number of crystals can determine whether a cloud
acts as a blanket to warm Earth or an umbrella to shield it from solar
radiation. But scientists aren't sure exactly where Arctic aerosols originate:
Are they swept north from land, or are they formed by ocean organisms and sent
skyward by breaking waves?"

"To gain some insight, Lauriane Quéléver, a chemist at the University of
Helsinki and her colleagues will spend the next year pulling air samples
through tubes mounted on a refashioned shipping container that serves as her
lab. Instruments will parse the samples, analyzing and counting particles.

"Quéléver was astonished to find that the number of particles soared to 28,000
per cubic centimeter—a few thousand times greater than the typical Arctic
level—when a second icebreaker arrived to swap instruments, personnel, and
fuel. "I really hope that I'm going to get some very natural and pristine
data," she says. "Otherwise I can just go home."

"A snowstorm or strong wind could help her and other scientists by clearing the
air, but that rarely happened during my stay. When I visited CU atmospheric
scientist Byron Blomquist, he was trying to collect air samples at a tower
hanging off the ship's bow. But his instruments weren't sampling anything; they
had automatically shut down after an alarm signaled that exhaust from the stern
of the ship was enveloping the tower. Inside his container, pumps roared like
vacuum cleaners as they pushed clean air out through his instruments, to
prevent contamination by the smog."

"Less than 24 hours after the Polarstern settled in, the ship's emissions were
smudging the ice. I noticed a black flake as large as my fingernail within the
icy floe, removed a mitten and picked it up, rubbing the flake between my
fingers. It turned to an oily smear. At the spot where the Polarstern had just
spent the night. There hung a thick yellow and brown cloud. "Just think," one
researcher said, "if we open the Arctic to shipping it's all going to look like
that."

    That's disturbing: not really seeing ice thickening at PS location on
    Cryo2Smos

Here the time series are using 26 rolling weekly averages according to the
Cryosat2 freeboard  / Smos thinness merger of observational ice thickness.
There is some thickening over this period in the 0.8 to 1.2 m range. Oddly the
ice is thicker to the southeast of the Polarstern's position.

It's hard to say whether that is notably fast or slow relative to past years
because there's no long term consistent data set using these satellites and the
refined merger algorithm.

Mosaic, in their floe planning, expected to find 1.2m ice here back on October
5th. That is 17 days before the first data frame here and 43 days before the
final frame (which has finally attained that thickness). So it's probably fair
to say that 1.2 m thickness is quite late.

20191111_20191117
...
20191016_20191022

Technical note: after setting the rectangle bounding the Polarstern's drift
over these dates (using locations in the S1AB database from sailwx), set the
color picker in Gimp to radius 5 which will fill the bounding box and take the
average. Then fill a small overlaid rectangle with this color and pick the
whole image with the non-contiguous color selector, capturing the local
selection on the palette bar after adding 0.05 m subdivisions from the grid
tool. The desired product (ice thickness growth in the Polarstern's vicinity)
is then the animation of the palette bar. This could be done on the original
png file without the -45º rotation to 'Greenland down' or better still by
utilizing the nicely done netCDF file in Panoply which includes error estimates
etc and has the option of exporting and analyzing numeric values of the equal
area projection pixels. However this won't change bottom-line talking points
obtained from much faster image analysis.

Hefaistos calls our attention to another excellent BBC piece on the Akademic
Fedorov trying to get home by Martha Henriques. It is best read in its entirety
but a few highlights are being posted below:

How not to get stuck in the Arctic sea ice
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/
20191114-how-mosaic-expedition-avoids-getting-stuck-in-arctic-sea-ice

Quote

    News reaches us that boxes of kit and the Polarstern’s large gangway fell
    into a widening stretch of water.


Odd, no mention of this :( event at 'Follow_Mosaic' :). Possible allusion to it
in Shupe's AGU blog. I struggled with 'boxes of kit'. Did the reporter mean
boxes of clothes, unloaded scientific equipment or just stuff/things in
general? Did they sink to the bottom of the sea or were they retrieved? Ditto
the large gangway, loss of that leaves them stranded on or off ship, other than
the mummy box chair unloaded by crane.

The Polarstern  is looking at a week of total blah weather ahead according to
GFS. I don't expect any significant net drift; there's no indication of when or
if the transpolar drift wind pattern will set up. Ice deformation can act from
afar but I don't expect that this week because the millions of sq km of weak
ice acts as a sponge that limits long range teleconnection of compression and
extension.

However the Mosaic floe is looking very beat up after the storms and wind
divergence on the two S1AB available for Nov 20th:

S1B   2019 11 20 T 06:02
S1B   2019 11 20 T 04:24

Quote

    The AK rams the same piece of ice back and forth, maybe 70 times. The drift
    of the ice meanwhile carries the ship north. During those hours of ramming,
    the ship drifted so far   that it got back almost to its starting latitude
    to the north before we finally broke through.

    Then the ship gets stuck a second time a few hours later and begins a
    second period of ramming. That’s when the captain decides to turn on the
    ship’s reserve engine. The Fedorov has four engines, but rarely uses all at
    once because this ramps up the ship’s fuel consumption. The fourth engine
    does the trick, helping the Fedorov break free again.

The captain really really did not want to get stuck for the winter in the ice.
The ship is sitting unusually high in the water after the crew shifted
scientific cargo onto the Polarstern plus 700 tons of diesel. The loss of
weight left the Fedorov sitting so high in the water that the hull
reinforcement area is now floating above the ice pack. The Fedorov is not a
true icebreaker to begin with.

If the Fedorov were to get stuck, we would have two options: help from the
Polarstern or hailing a nuclear-powered icebreaker such as the Yamal. "They are
all busy and you don’t know when you will get one. And of course they are very,
very expensive.”

The photo below shows how the 25 m wake sealed up almost immediately. The ship
was in a compressive regime so ridging was almost immediate.

The merged cryosat2-smos v2.02 data appears to go back to nov2010 at AWI
(someone's been busy :) ) so a mid term comparison could perhaps be made.

It's been a long journey through google, guesswork, commas and brackets to buoy
labels. Today I got the lucky click. So, an update on drift speed of the
meereis Pbuoys closest to Polarstern from nov14-20, latest data at ~04:00, with
labels. (temporarily without tails)

edit: Polarstern is currently roughly half way between [DEL:p204:DEL] p201 and
p207. The buoy on the edge of the floe [DEL:'fortress':DEL] STIPAKAF ;) is not
shown here.
somewhat thicker ice previously also known as fortress

Added an overlay of Pbuoys with labels near Polarstern, circled in red, on
today's S1B 04:24 image. The buoy colours just happen to be inverse of drift
speed of a much shorter animation. It was an easy way to make them more
visible. Click for full resolution.

I suggest the term "fortress" is permanently banned to describe supposedly
highly dependable thick ice. It may be jinxing things.

A-Team thanks for the amazing series of posts.

 A seasoned Arctic sailor/explorer saying the Polar stern is like a "5 star
hotel"  is not likely the same judgement a much less field seasoned scientist
might reach. I think that given the environment they face,  a warm ship is
imperative. Good food has "magical powers" in stressful situations.
Entertainment, good rest and privacy are all required for optimal operation of
long missions,  under -20C temperatures, in absolute darkness, over a cracking
surface, surrounded by hungry polar bears.

 The Polarstern and its crew of live subjects are not there just to do
experiments in the Arctic, they are part of the experiment. They cannot remove
themselves from it. They can only minimize their impact and keep their biases
in check.  That is not easy because their presence there is like fire on ice.

 This is already amazing research, and this is only the beginning.

Well put, Archi.

I say lay on the amenities, whatever it takes for creature comforts. They have
been worried about sustaining Leg 2 morale since the get-go. They'll be beyond
the reach of planes, helicopters and even support icebreakers over that time
frame.

Mosaic has not released a ship's roster so we don't even know whom to thank.
There's crew of 44 and capacity for 80 scientific and technical staff at any
given time according to wiki. Most of the people are there to maintain complex
instruments at remote sites (no easy job) though scientific team leaders are
alongside working too. The breakthrough on internet bandwidth has made a big
difference on who needs to be present.

Esther Horvath, photographer and communications manager of the MOSAiC
expedition "wants to document the unknown faces on the front lines of climate
science. "Who are the scientists? This is what I'm extremely interested in; to
show climate change stories through the eyes of scientists, showing how they
live in such an extreme remote location."

Chief scientist:
Markus Rex PS122/1: 20 Sep 2019 – 15 Dec 2019
Christian Haas PS122/2: 15 Dec 2019 – 15 Feb 2020
Torsten Kanzow PS122/3: 15 Feb 2020 – 15 Apr 2020
Markus Rex PS122/4: 15 Apr 2020 – 15 Jun 2020
Dieter Wolf-Gladrow PS122/5: 15 Jun 2020 – 15 Aug 2020
Markus Rex PS122/6: 15 Aug 2020 – 14 Oct 2020

The photo today shows some of the damage from recent ice dynamics. We've seen
this already on Sentinel but don't know the specifics. However Mosaic has been 
very cagey about providing a revised map of Ice Camp as-built (and re-built and
re-built again) or shareing measured ice elevations above and below.

For example, the open lead necessitating the bridge has itself been cropped out
of the photo. We have no idea where the Ocean City and Remote Sensing Site are
located today nor how serious the fracture is nor how to follow it on remote
sensing.

I don't think this secrecy serves them. The damage control and data hoarding is
pure paranoia. No ship radar with 100 Mbps internet? Dumbing down GPS position
-- do they fear a cruise missile? What is someone going to do with bearing data
beyond a scarcely publishable fourier analysis?

What it boils down to is somebody on the grant committee -- Mosaic dipped
deeply into a pot shared with Antarctica and Greenland -- said 'this is never
going to work plus it's been done before by N-ICE2015 and SHEBA'. And if they
had access to minute by minute floe motion, would now be saying 'I told you so,
no way time evolution of a single floe can be followed for a whole year'.

So it seems to be about embarrassment. They are making zero headway on the
drift, have no prospects of drifting over the Pole, and the floe is rearranging
itself daily if not disintegrating, undercutting the  key talking point about
research novelty. This is why Shupe chose the name 'Fortress' for a crummy ice
jumble and put it on Mosaic maps.

Today saw the usual turmoil on the Mosaic floe and also some puzzling (since
winds have abated) regional torque with the ice no longer moving coherently
over the short time frame between two S1AB. Divergent wind stress from
yesterday cannot be the attribution because there's not even short term
conservation of linear or angular ice momentum because of way too much
frictional dissipation.

The two Sentinels are co-registered on the Polarstern (red dot); the faux
interferometry that shows complex regional motion in this coordinate frame used
the S1AB grayscale average for the 3rd luminance channel of the HSL 'RGB'.

Well, if nothing else, it's a pleasure to have almost daily multiple sentinel
images of the same area and a wide range of buoys to determine, eventually, how
to interpret those images. Sometimes the devil is in the detail.

At risk of overkill, while setting up for a longer term buoy overlay onto S1AB
animation I came across this. nov17-18 with 50% intermediate frame, click to

    A lot of movement overnight

This was the worst ice dynamics yet ... and just after they got done laying a
bridge over a recurrent lead with scrap palettes and a wooden sled. It is
unfortunate that the remote experimental stations have to be tethered to the
ship with power, data and fuel lines because these are subject to breakage and
burial.

The massive rift chain to the Polarstern's southeast (fresh leads are black on
S1AB) shows the response of the ice to to divergent wind stress: extensional
faulting resembling NW trending Nevada basin and ranges as the Pacific Plate
scrapes past the N American -- and about on the same distance scale. Both play
out slowly in time; here the ice failed a couple days after the "84º" wind
divergence event pictured in the GFS post above.

A parallel fault zone runs above, below and so far around the Mosaic floe. So
far, it has mostly been around because the Fortress is not the path of least
resistance for fractures (being thicker). The two Sentinels for the day are in
and 'follow-mosaic' :) seems to run a couple days behind events, so unless
skies are infrared-clear we won't know until 03:30 utc on Friday what is
currently going on.

No question though that the Mosaic floe has experienced some strong ice
dynamics even though the wind has been and will be mild short-term. The
shifting ice we can see between Sentinel orbits only 3.25 hrs apart may or may
not translate to significant damage to remote towers and lines.

The Polarstern itself, forming a barrier much higher than ice, seems to attract
ridging, which on the stern side would seem to require daily resetting of slack
lines mooring the ship to ice anchors. This recurrent lead/ridge may have
originated from the icebreakers maneuvering early on.

Between onboard pollution from the ship's stacks and daily repairs to deployed
sensors, scientists may not be getting the steady data streams expected. It
would be no better on another floe. Trip leaders said early on that this was
probably the last possible year for such an expedition. Maybe it was last year.

It's always been clear that Sentinel radar images, like Ascat scatterometery,
arrives at sub-optimal visual contrast but it's never been clear how to best
fix a given image, much less make a matching stack for a time series given
variations between different orbital angles and nadirs.

Sentinel currently provides 82 images back to mooring on Oct 5th with only five
days of missing coverage. The attached S1AB csv database has been merged with
sailwx, AwiMet and nullschool GFS to bring in location, wind speed, wind
direction, air temperature and links.

The easiest thing to do in terms of small file sizes, convenient format, quick
turn-around and pioneering a pipeline for the the ultimate unattended objective
fix of the jp2 is use the jpg for now and its intrusive graticule, followed by
the Level tool in gimp, as shown in the mini-tutorial attached.

Sentinel images on ice are inherently speckled and while 'there's a app for
that'  a slight unsharp mask can bring further small benefits. One size does
not fit all however: improving a 100x100 km scene is not optimal for smaller
sub-scenes like the Mosaic floe. There we would like to maximally improve the
resolution or clarity of the image right around the Polarstern and the Mosaic
floe.

Awright! AWI finally posted an updated but already outdated map of the ice camp
and its drifting pieces. The bad news is that the map is badly out of focus
because designers did not anticipate what 'social media' would do resizing it
for phones. This topic will never be trending with millennials; few could even
locate Norway on a map.

I have not been able to locate the actual map. Actually it is very affordable
to have an ordinary web site and simply post stuff in html 1.0 and upload
intact big figures with ftp. In fact they could just use my site for free and
get their incompetent graphics fixed to boot. They really shot themselves in
the foot with this crazy complex javascript and cascading style sheet eye
candy. It doesn't work.

Next we read about how they cannot track locations of their remote equipment.
Apparently they don't co-install a buoy, tracker beacon, two-dollar flasher or
radar reflector on expensive remote equipment (OPM: other peoples money). They
could have just emailed uniq on their 100 Mbps internet to get the current
drift.

The fuel cell failure mode is exactly what they would get in Minnesota on a
cold day. The rising number of mundane equipment failures makes me wonder about
pre-trip testing standards. This is an austere lunar landscape, not a
mid-latitude campus.

Reading to end of this blog, it appears one co-leader has a very loose grip on
what drives TransPolar Drift (in recent years, not much and very erratically)
and on what is going down right now: one cyclone chasing another when TPD 
anti-cyclones are way overdue. They seem not to look at GFS even 2-3 days out
for a drift forecast.

The way things are going -- and given what is coming -- perhaps it is time to
consider a staged withdrawal:

-- Forget about fancy remote area deployments, pull back to the ship, put out
more autonomous buoys, do helicopter forays to benefit satellite photo
interpretation, carry out excursions to measure ice thickness, let the ship
loose and motor slowly into the wind to keep the bow air clean. The ship moored
to solid ice makes for a poor platform not fit for purpose because unavoidable
emissions severely impact atmospheric and other monitoring goals.

-- Wind down Leg 1 in an orderly manner and consider downsizing, repurposing or
even eliminating Leg 2. The Mosaic floe as originally envisioned is dead in the
water. It is being torn apart and rearranged almost daily; no purpose is served
by continued monitoring the core ice jumble-ridge which is atypical and
unrepresentative of the Arctic ice pack.

-- Don't admit to planning mistakes but don't continue with them either. Give
the redesign a new wrapper called responsive resilient adaptive management
(RRAM) or similar.

    11/9/19 Another Failed Mission
    Postcards from a frozen icebreaker – Part 12 19 Nov 2019
    By Matthew Shupe

    L1 radiometer flight as high on the agenda today… but kept getting pushed
    back. Including by a bear visit, which closed down most operations. But
    finally in the afternoon we were able to hit the air. Loaded our gear on
    the helicopter….. sled, ladder, shovel, feather duster (great for
    instrument cleaning), tool box, numerous safety bags, rifle for the bear
    guard and a spare, personal kits (need those spare gloves), and most
    importantly our replacement power systems.

    It is about 280 lbs…. two big batteries and a fuel cell, all set up in a
    box. We fired it up for about an hour before the flight to get it all
    toasty warm inside. Then shut it down, closed the box, and loaded it on the
    helicopter.

    On site the plan is to quickly get it over to the flux station, plug it
    into a fuel cartridge, and fire it up again, to stay warm while we prepare
    the station for the power system transplant. Such a great plan…… but
    unfortunately the remote controlled helicopter landing lights at the remote
    station did not work, so we flew around for 1.5 hour looking for it.

    So tough to find as everything is white (and snow covered) but it is
    totally dark out. Part of the challenge is that GPS coordinates quickly
    become outdated due to the ice drift. We get a reading from a buoy from ½
    hour before but the whole pack has moved. This unsuccessful search had me
    really bummed and wondering if/when we would find this site.

    It all went off without a hitch or at least without a big hitch on 11/10/
    19. Well planned in advance, we had the right tools and our specially
    concocted power system in a box. Beautiful clear skies and cold…. Below
    -30C for the first time at MOSAiC. The helicopter dropped us off at the L1
    site, some 15 km away from Polarstern. Our new power system is getting
    colder. It won’t start if it gets below the freezing point.

    We started up the spare system right away so it could keep itself warm,
    then opened up the old system, dark and cold, to remove the frozen system.
    The exhaust system was the culprit, a huge frozen beard extending down from
    where the water exhaust drips out. Ice extending up the exhaust tube

    They could have just emailed uniq

One day I'll post a picture of our satellite dish strapped to a tree :) .

Made a mistake after playing with the buoy animation but left it as is since it
shows the full path. It may be the sudden change in direction that opened up
all the leads. A bit late, I was catching up with the spacex thread.

    that sudden change in direction opened up all the leads

Or whiplash. When the eye of a hurricane/cyclone passes overhead as it kinda
did here, the wind reverses direction. Extensional leads rather than
compressional ridges because ice on the edges moves centrifugally outwards. But
where exactly and what good would advance knowledge do for the Polarstern?

In terms of replacing the white base under your buoy animations with
appropriately dated S1AB or nullschool GFS winds (to get at the correlation
pictorially), the S1AB go about 20 hours between 3 close coverages and the GFS
3 hours whereas the buoys commonly report hourly. So there is somewhat of a
mismatch in time resolution to buoy GPS.

The Simb3 buoys report every four hours. However most buoys can be programmed
to call in at whatever interval, from ten minutes on up. Some may be able to
take downlink re-programming calls.

Windy gives update intervals and the time of update release (as of 2016
unfortunately) for all the common weather satellites and has stopped providing
Arctic ECMWF.

https://community.windy.com/topic/3340/
when-and-how-often-are-the-weather-data-updated

On the four Simb3, call them abcd, retrieving their record of 924 dial-ups back
to Oct 6th deployment revealed quite a mix of buoy position reporting
combinations that complicate matters for making two delaunay triangles or just
one  (or just an inter-buoy line) consistently.

The attached csv database is tricked out with extra sort columns to enable
extraction of any desired sub-collection. The Simb3 are key to local ice
thickness development, in combination with whole-ocean 25x25 km cryo2smos.

636 abcd   (all buoys reporting)
086 bcd    (buoy a not reporting)
041 cd     (buoys ab not reporting)
012 abd    (buoy c not reporting)
012 acd    (buoy b not reporting)
011 c      (buoys abd not reporting)
006 abc    (buoy d not reporting)
002 ac     (buoys bd not reporting)
002 bd     (buoys ac not reporting)

Uniq and macID have built a better mousetrap. That is, one-hour ice movement is
much more refined than two-day OsiSaf as a better match to the intrinsic time
scale of winter ice movement.

That is, the PS lat lon changed, in 1026 available hour increments at awiMet as
poorly measured by one dp data are distributed as below. Note 0.1 in lon is a
lot less distance travelled than 0.1 in lat this far north; the distribution
estimate could be refined by using 4 hr windows. The Polerstern is currently
moving very slowly south and east.

667 no change lat, no change lon
151 no change lat, westward 0.1 lon
117 no change lat, eastward 0.1 lon
010 0.1 south in lat, no change in lon
004  0.1 north in lat, no change in lon
002 no change lat, 0.3 westward in lon
006 no change lat, 0.2 westward in lon
008 no change lat, 0.2 eastward in lon 
002 0.1 north in lat, 0.1 west in lon
003 0.1 north in lat, 0.1 east in lon
010 miscellaneous

While ice motion so described is limited to inside the buoy envelope, it could
give advance notice to the Polarstern of leads and ridges outside their
immediate location in advance of the next S1AB. The buoy pattern is in effect
an imaging device, resembling the discretized ommatidia of a small invertebrate
eye.

OsiSaf uses pattern recognition but those point features (virtual buoys) change
from day to day and can be quite sparse. OsiSaf is not currently pointed at
S1AB but could be, giving ultra-refined ice motion between timestamps in
conjunction with the buoy product.

Clearly uniq could dump the gridded underlying data into netCDF time series
format to distribute the underlying numerology though trailing tails (but not
colors) would be lost.

The situation has gotten increasingly dire in the immediate vicinity of the
Mosaic ice camp as extensional forces have opened multiple km-wide bands. A
second Sentinel image of 05:46 has just come in that provides a snapshot of
ongoing motion -- the situation has worsened considerably in the last three
hours. PolarView has just now posted a third intermediate time, the 04:08, but
we won't be able to follow events further until tomorrow morning other than
hourly weather and drift which are unremarkable (there's no storm) since the
last S1AB:

   Lat  Long  YY-MM-DD  UTC     Wind       T(C)  hPa
  85.7  120.7 19-11-22 10:00    5   50    -16.3 1016.0
  85.7  120.8 19-11-22 09:00    4   40    -17.0 1015.5
  85.7  120.8 19-11-22 08:00    5   10    -16.1  1015.0
  85.7  120.8 19-11-22 07:00    4  340    -16.1  1014.5

This event will be extremely disruptive to all deployed experimental equipment
and effectively destroys the floe for purposes of studying its evolution over a
year. Let's hope the Polarstern and all the people aboard stay safe as the
event continues to unfold today.

This is a very unfortunate situation ultimately attributable to climate change,
its amplification in the Arctic Ocean and the long-term trend to thinner, more
mobile ice that cannot resist wind stresses.

The upper two images follow Mosaic convention with north up, the first needs a
click to display full size; the lower animation has S1AB orientation of the
Pole down the 120º meridian with inverted insets in coordinates attached to the
ship at 2x enlargement.  The 4x enlargement is also north down after contrast
leveling and light unsharp mask.

Some of the 87 surviving autonomous buoys out of the 100 deployed in the Mosaic
project will likely succumb to the same ice pack deformations affecting the
Polarstern. So far, they all reported on the 22nd or 23rd with the exceptions
below. All but the last two are Chinese buoys that have previously had
reporting delays.

Why so many big leads during relatively calm weather? I reread the two posts
above :)

Update on drift speed, this time looking more closely at the polarstern area
from nov19-22 ~03:30. PS is roughly half way between p201 and p207. The
diagonal is 120E, the line top right is 85.5N. I'll attempt to add more
graticule with labels and a rough time as we go along.
I wonder if they can feel any of that movement, in particular the recent jolt
to the north shown by the more easterly buoys.

@macid, have you ever tried ncdf4

Wow, thanks for pointing that out, Uniquorn.

But what's the chicken and what the egg here? ;)

    Why so many big leads during relatively calm weather?

Even though wind speeds have been mild, wind velocity has been very confused in
the 200x200 km sector centered to the SE and including the Polarstern. The weak
ice of today experiences mechanical failure upon being pulled in different
directions even under moderate stress.

The alternative, a delayed reaction to stresses from storm last weekend,
doesn't hold water: too many days have elapsed. However that storm was likely a
major contributing factor in establishing the initial ice fractures that later
became big leads, opening easily under mild divergent winds.

The next cyclone rolling in will brush the Polarstern on Nov 24th before
wandering off to Severnaya Zemlya. Winds will be fairly strong (peaking ~32 km/
hr) for a day but GFS does not foresee surface winds anywhere near the 51 km/hr
of the last storm. Wind stress goes roughly as the cube, so the previous event
was 4.3x worse.

Note Uniq's buoy trajectories are in effect a non-gridded replacement for
OsiSaf ice motion with a fantastically improved time resolution, an hour vs 48
hours. Given that buoys report location to 4-5 decimal points, whereas OsiSaf
is applying AI to low resolution all-Arctic imagery, the accuracy is much
higher with the buoy mesh.

The tangent vectors to these curves at the times the S1AB are taken (not marked
or paused yet) are then the arrows that should be drawn over the high
resolution imagery instead of what we see at mosaic_multisensor. These arrows
will be very accurate both in magnitude and direction.

Even if F not quite = ma under the circumstances, it is close enough for
citizenry work. Here we want to get at the force acting on the floe in which
the buoy is emplaced or rather its rigid body extension. Here you would want go
back to an old indian trick called Newtonian Differences rather than
differentiate fitted continuous curves.

Set up a column of positions, let the adjacent column subtract t from t-1 and
fill down, let the third column do the same for the second, recalling change of
position with time is velocity and change in velocity with time is acceleration
which with mass fixed amounts to force acting (geometrically the tangent to the
velocity curve). These new columns are to be colored differently in
supplemental animations though the time steps and positions remain the same.

OsiSaf ice motion is severely biased by the big moves during the 48 hour block;
if for example, these might be in the first two hours with the latter 46
providing little displacement, then the image served will not be at all
current. This explains the apparent incomparability with GFS 3-hr winds.

Just when I was going to post a little gif A-team makes it redundant.

Here it is any way -
- calm tomorrow,
- 24 Nov       South wind 30 kmh
- 25-26 Nov  East wind 20 kmh
- 27 Nov much calmer but still FJL next stop.

Given the state of the floe and the surrounding area it all looks a bit dodgy,
but just as well those big winds in the Beaufort / Chukchi / Bering Strait are
a long way away.

As they say in every episode of all the best Police series "Take care out
there".

Let's get this right because this is a very serious ongoing event.

Supposing this weekend storm had a causative role in the present troubles at
the Polarstern, it might be worth overlaying the 3-hr nullschools over the
changing S1AB, using the PS positions in the computed nullschool url as
provided for everyone's convenience in an earlier cvs attachment.

The synthetic problem though is the resolution of nullschool maxes out at its
'3000' scale whereas the S1AB ROI for Mosaic is just a postage stamp then under
the GFS, with vice versa no better. However S1AB still conveys the lead
situation zoomed out so there might be a workable compromise that doesn't
overshoot the 700 pixel forum width too badly.

Technical note: as above, take whole window screenshots and layer up in Gimp.
To avoid jerking the nullschool image with inadvertant mouse-overs, use
keyboard commands lik j and k to advance and back the time by 3 hours. Three
days is 24 layers; that won't result in an overly large final file. Duplicate
the file twice and crop to the url and data box for wind speed. Crop the main
file to final size and enlarge the canvas on the duplicates to match. Then tile
up as three layers, add the S1AB layers duplicate to match, add transparency to
the GFS, flatten over the radar, then slice the tile over in ImageJ, save as
animated gif, open and re-save in gimp with good pauses where appropriate. YES
YOU CAN.

AWI communications have been strangely unscientific. The daily 'follow' blog is
misdated, a day or more behind events depicted; photos have no timestamps,
exifs are stripped; ship time is updated weekly but not provided, we have no
idea what UTC the news refers to; the twitter feed is hardly used, no one on
board is sharing despite huge bandwidth, the Helmholtz blog has gone dead, ship
GPS is obfuscated and so on. It is not a good idea to apply spin templates from
political campaigns to scientific matters. Honesty is the best policy.

    @macid, have you ever tried ncdf4

can read netcdf and still some room left for learning, what should go in the
netcdf, just a conversion of the bouy csv with dimensions for lat, lon, time
and values for the working buoy data?

I don't understand what you want to do with it A-Team tbh but happy to look

He could load it into panoply and look at stuff without R skills.

Here is a buoy overlay onto yesterdays 03:27 S1B. The buoy locations are taken
from frame 3 of a 23 frame animation of yesterday's buoy data (I haven't worked
out how to limit hours yet). macid may correct me but I think R animate makes
frames from an average of available data, letting you choose how many frames
make up the animation. Buoys that send data every 10m would probably be
averaged. Perhaps it would be interesting to select only those buoys and run a
more detailed ani, depending on their locations. Many of the pbuoy's data ends
at 2300 when I download it s we have to wait. 3 or 4 hours is a lot of movement
these days.
The file is big but it's click to run  It's only Neven's storage bill slowly
creeping up ;) Optimising reduced file size by 40%. An animation of this poses
some challenges.

Polarstern shows up clearly between p201 and p207.

    why netcdf?

It is first about mainstreaming the buoy project. It's such a good one that
resistance is futile.

For better or worse, nc and hdf have become the meeting ground for sharing
climate data, excel/mysql wrapped in steroids. System integrators -- builders
of the immense robotic pipelines of climate science -- do not want to crawl a
hundred sites, massage a hundred formats, write a hundred unresponsive
sysadmins, nor tweak other people's ad hoc code.

In fact the whole idea is not to look at the raw data at all but assume it is
schema-compliant so a remote climate modeler or weather prediction provider can
ingest it over and over without further intervention.

It is second about getting out of banks of numbers into bottom-line pictures:
working on a more limited scale within Panoply, an open and active low learning
curve netCDF data viewer, data type combiner and map-maker that allows the
average joe/sephine to put out a decent and original product, for example
changing projection to equal area or re-scaling to overlay properly on
satellite products, or here correlating ice mobility with say surface wind
speed or vertical ice temperature profile.

In other words, it is better to crunch pictures than numbers. Or rather
multiple correlated stacks of pictures. Why? Because you can see what you are
doing, because there are ten thousand intuitive photoshop-type algos, because
the data is inherently indexed by location and timestamp.

It's all about rapid prototyping. Work with the pictures until you know there
will be a result, then go back to the numbers and do it right.

Is this a spec for implementing buoy position and sensor data as netCDF? I
would say no, it's little more than a vague vision statement looking down the
road to better sharing.

Is the priority so high that the weekend should be spent immersed in
human-unreadable binary? For me, I would say no to that.

Here is a stomach-churning zoom centered at the Polarstern to go with that very
effective hangover blur above. The last S1B of Nov 22nd has been rotated so
that the pole is to the bottom left.

The second image shows a cyclone forming in the upper Fram and wandering up to
the Polarstern's location before drifting off to the Kara Sea. The effects on
leads and ridging would be fairly minor except for pre-conditioned fissures.
Whatever the drift induced in the ship, even if it mimics transpolar drift, has
nothing to do with transpolar drift.

The mp4, adapted from Uniq above with the Mosaic floe circled, shows the very
unfortunate situation the Polarstern is in relative to large scale failures in
the ice pack. Be sure to set on loop so it will rocks back and forth.

The 3x enlargement shows extreme disruption of the Mosaic ice camp over this
time frame. Black lines are open water of new leads; white lines are pressure
ridges. The Polarview portal to Sentinel imagery is currently badly broken and
no files of any kind are available yet for today, the 23rd.

Mp4 are now easy to make in forum-acceptable form by saving ImageJ stacks to
avi and then applying cloudconvert. It requires dimensions be even.

Right. At first it looks like one of those pen machines putting a personal
touch on a massive junk mail campaign. But the trails actually differ quite a
bit in their details upon trying to overlay them by a simple translational
move. The question is, how to distinguish deformation from shear and
discontinuities such as a lead opening.

The long PolarView weekend continues. I wrote them, they are off somewhere not
responding. The pink square masking goes away if all but S1 are de-checked;
problem is now in the feed. No new images have been ingested since the 22nd.

Mosaic is going to new extremes to keep the world uninformed.

Thanks. Quite a big lead in that rough location. Maybe they had to move some
gear. The overlay is on to nov22 S1B as there were no images yesterday, so the
120 lines don't match up. click to run

The image below takes Uniq's animation #303 above, attaches the hour to each of
the 100 frames, then adds the S1AB of that hour when one of the nine relevant
ones is available. The png below just looks at frame 77 which had the latest
S1.

Relative to buoy tracks, this time was well after the hairpin 180º but close to
the final wiggles which were double to the east but triple to the west, at a
bad time for the deployed Polarstern equipment.

The ESA/Copernicus could not have picked a worse time to skip two days of
coverage of the Mosaic project. We know satellite went overhead at the usual
times; we don't know why they shut down the radar that makes EW-format scenes.
Maybe it was set to some other mode for some other purpose (?). At any rate,
the RAMMB becomes the supplemental tool of choice.

    ... aims at fulfilling, during the routine exploitation phase, the
    observation requirements of the Copernicus services and of ESA/EU member
    states ... a secondary objective is to satisfy other SAR user communities,
    ensuring continuity of ERS/Envisat, considering requirements from the
    scientific community, as well as from international partners and
    cooperation activities.

    The elaboration of a pre-defined observation plan necessitates solving, a
    priori, the potential conflict among users (e.g. different SAR operation
    modes or polarisation schemes required over same geographical area).Wave
    Mode (WV) continuously operated over open oceans, with lower priority
    versus the high rate modes. Interferometric Wide swath (IW) and Extra Wide
    swath (EW) modes operated over pre-defined geographical areas: over seas
    and polar areas, and ocean relevant areas, pre-defined mode is either IW or
    EW. In exceptional cases only, emergency observation requests may alter the
    pre-defined observation scenario, potentially requiring the use of the
    Stripmap (SM) mode.

Steps and rationales in placing an S1 image under its buoy time frame:

rotate S1 of 05:46 22.11.19 cw 45º in ImageJ
measure scale between 85-86 at 2712.46 pixels or 813.7 pixels per 0.3 deg of
lat
animation scale between 85.6 and 85.9 which is 0.3 deg of lat is 369.6 pixels
consequently the S1 needs to be downscaled by 45.42% to fit under animation
frame 77 need to find 85.6 120 on the S1 to know how far to drag it.
given 85.0 and 86.0 corners, it will be 0.6 * 2712.46  = 739.2 pixels down from
85.0
add a blank layer and put a green dot there.
put a big red * over the Polarstern on the image
add frame 77 and final frame 100 overlays and co-slide to 85.6 120
autocrop to get rid of S1 that is not under frame 77.
note PS is 53 pxl left and 6 pxl down relative to buoy P204 on frame 77
for future PS put a magenta star 53 pxl left and 6 pxl down relative to buoy
P204 on frame 100
sailwx is saying PS is at 85.7 120.3 on frame 100 which is at 04:30 on 11.23.19
put a orange star 27.4 pxls up from 85,7 (in a blank layer, don’t cover up
data).
copy out P204’s route, color it cyan and translocate it from PS f77 to PS f100
for
that gives hypothetical intermediate drift that we can test with RAMMB
ship GPS is only 1 dp so has a large uncertainty orange box
save a new-from-visible png enlarged to ~700
 
repeat for all the frames that have a nearby S1 time and post to forum later
most of the steps are the same for all S1 and
steps vary simply if Uniq changes buoy animation scale and orientation

05:46   22 11 19
04:08   22 11 19
02:30   22 11 19

    The overlay is on to nov22 S1B as there were no images yesterday, so the
    120 lines don't match up.

If the Rammb is enlarged 3x but its PS held at the PS S1 location, then the
120's do fall into line which shifts the second location to the magenta
half-circle.

Mosaic has not disclosed the location of remotely deployed equipment, only
sites within a km of the Polarstern. We are not certain this is a helicopter
but it is surely not the icebreaker bringing supplies as that is not due for
several weeks.

Maybe that should be from the projected PS loc for nov23

A major breakthrough for the buoy animations today. We now have dates! Though
please see below for a view on how accurate they may be. This one goes back to
nov17 to show todays movement retracing the previous path. We also have minimal
manually added lat/lon labels.

Tech note: Best efforts are made to make the frame count the same as the number
of hours, so the time should be accurate to the hour, probably much closer.

    transition_along makes the following variables available for string literal
    interpretation, in addition to the general ones provided by animate():
        frame_along gives the position on the along-dimension that the current
    frame corresponds to

https://rdrr.io/github/dgrtwo/gganimate/man/transition_reveal.html
I would never have guessed 'frame along' in a million years, but, eventually,
after asking the right question....


Some background on the method used for the buoy animations
Quote

    When we animate data visualisations we often do it by calculating
    intermediary data points resulting in a smooth transition between the
    states represented by the raw data. In gganimate this is done by adding a
    transition which defines how data should be expanded across the animation
    frames. Underneath it all most transitions calculate intermediary data
    representations using tweenr and transformr — so far, so good.

    What we have glanced over, and what is at the center of the problem, is
    what state of the data we decide to use as basis for our expansion. If you
    are not familiar with ggplot2 and the grammar of graphics this might be a
    strange phrasing — data is data — but if you are, you’ll know that data can
    undergo several statistical transformations before it is encoded into a
    visual property and put on paper (or screen).

Agreed. You only see it in one frame. If it was a ship you should see it way
longer.

Good idea, will implement along with enlarging the underlying S1 and optimizing
the contrast for enlargement. Or maybe leave the Rammb as is and shrink the S1
as that is easier to back up to full or even enlarged once the suspect region
is identified.

85.7  120.35 19-11-23 06:30    5  220  for location of PS at time of double
heat source and wind
85.7  120.8   19-11-22 05:00    for location of the earlier S1B so a decent
move

The frames are a whole orbit apart? That is usually a bit over an hour for
near-polar, sun synchronous. Says 51 minutes above, so low orbit. Another
possibility is heat from a fuel cell starting up. Or burning up -- drain holes
were blocking up with refreezing melt water from their process. They were
replacing them the other day by the Polarstern. And a remote one in the AGU
blog. Of course those would be brought in by a helicopter so go figure.

Given the situation with Sentinels, it's probably worth looking into optimizing
the Rammb archive a bit more. The contrast as initially provided uses about a
fifth of the histogram. And some of the frames may provide recognizable details
in the ice depending on local cloud cover. Bottom line though is the resolution
is way worse than Sentinels.

Airplane engine heat maybe possible; is this a flight route between Asian and
London?. Polar-5 and Polar-6 are not going out there until the piston bullies
can groom an airstrip; the ice ridging  and dynamics make that problematic.

amazing work on the labels, graticules and dates now, you should put your own
name on it ;) I couldn't get frame_along to work with something else, to much
headaches in the end. It's easy to make it work one way.. but combine stuff and
suddenly you have to play hostage negotiator.

in Panoply I can't see a way to load non-gridded data, and a sensible way to
arrange this buoy data into grid format eludes me, use a fine grid and fill
non-positions with nulls? Calculated vector values may make sense to put in a
grid but I need a few courses to get there.

    put buoy data into netCDF for broader data integration?

Thanks for looking into it. Sure, nulls and fine grid. The thing to look at is
OsiSaf .nc to see what they did for sea ice motion vectors, just copy what they
did with the buoy data. We're looking for Geo2D file format in Panoply,
geo-referenced. Anything less just produces distorted rectangular grids.
Panoply will overlay buoy tracks on cryo2smos thickness. Some weirdness from
the buoy data covering so little of a whole ocean polar stereographic.

I'll second that! Compare it to the very best that this $150,000,000 project
seems capable of producing. 0.01% of that budget could have got them first-rate
graphics. All those unsecured boxes of kit that sank off the side, how much of
the budget went down with them? Flying around 1.5 hr in the helicopter looking
in vain for an expensive installation because they didn't track on GPS?

Talking to the spouse (who has ZERO interest in anything scientific) about all
the Mosaic breakdowns. Response: the expedition was always just a lark,
adventuring.

One Sentinel has come in so far this morning, the 02:54 of Nov 25th. It just
barely captured the Mosaic floe. The previous S1, the 05:46 of Nov 22, means a
3-day gap in coverage unprecedented back into September. Polarview is now
ingesting mid-morning images so no more coverage of the Polarstern for today.

All the open leads have sealed so we will never know what happened during the
chaos in the early morning of the 22nd other than what is in the three images
available. However the weaknesses created by divergent wind stress will stay
weak for the remainder of the winter and may re-open later. The red line in the
final frame below may be a persistent lead or ridge associated with swaths
early on made by the two icebreakers. 

The version below of Uniq's most excellent three-buoy comparison is squeezed to
increase the separation of the tracks and runs back and forth as an mp4. Be
sure to set controls to loop. The file size is so small on these because all
the blank spaces compresses dramatically; the forum could show 50x the time
period within its 10 MB limit.

On the 3rd animation, I've collected 16 of the 344 frames of Uniq's 3-buoy
animation that have Sentinel scenes at the same time. There's enough empty
space to add an actual thumbnail from the S1AB inventory of Mosaic floe images.

The bottom image shows the track of the Polarstern as adapted from the Rammb
infrared sequence above.

Technical note: It is easy to add a dimmed out rest-of-track to each of the
earlier frames to make it clear what is coming next. That is done by
desaturating the final frame, excising the date and scale, duplicating 16x,
tiling, lowering opacity and setting to 'darken only' in gimp, then reslicing
the 'make new layer from visible' to the final animation.

Nice, the mosaic floe images give a bit more meaning to the movement info.
Today's update, still retracing. It should be noted that the buoy animations
are rotated -45deg from Greenland down. Similar to the mercator default image.

The secret to rotation may be in here somewhere

Very nice addition, rog!

Smooth sailing ahead? The rifting episode of 22 Nov 2019 is over but the last
four Sentinel-1 images (blue lines) are still show quite a bit of turmoil in
the main experimental area. The Polarstern has been very slowly moving north
but mostly moving west the last two days under moderate wind speed (5th
column), winds direction swinging around (6th column) under cold temperatures
and unremarkable barometric pressure.

Here the tenth of a degree of latitudinal shift from 86.0 to 86.1 represents a
distance of 11.1 km whereas that distance requires a degree and a half of
longitudinal change (at 86.0). So over the time frame of the table below the
Polarstern has moved 17.7 km. They are currently 1472 km away from their
destination of Longyearben, Svalbard which would be ~180 days away if this pace
kept up (it won't).

    or maybe not ;)

Coordinate conversion uses Proj4js, no rotation option for stereographic
projections. Manipulating the longitude in the dataset prior to conversion
would achieve something similar (as long as there's no terrain height in the
plotted area) or a there use rotate functions for x,y datasets after
conversion.

But next is rotating the map and graticules, Plotsvalbard map would be messed
up.. may as well go to raw ggplotting at this point. Which I should do anyway,
because I can't get PSvalbard to work in Ubuntu (trying to take developing a
bit more seriously)

    Manipulating the longitude in the dataset prior to conversion

Went with lon = (data$longitude..deg. +45), lat = data$latitude..deg.    from
the line before which appears to have the desired effect, though doesn't affect
the underlying map, as you say. Should be ok till they hit land (and no bathy)

So, we have rotation and lat/lon labels. You wait ages for a lucky click and
then 3 come along at once. And then music.

That manually placed 86N label is at 86.1 Will fix it and repost later(see
below)

Tech note: Lat/Lon data is to 3 or 4 decimal places, rounded here for visual
reasons. There are still some overlaps.
Forgot to change lon lines so 120E is not shown. Check the numbers

There is a golden opportunity to study how ice drift correlates with wind
direction during an unusual period of steady wind speed and direction in in
late October. As Nansen observed during the voyage of the Fram, motion of the
ice was almost always offset from the direction of the wind. However he lacked
the big picture that we have today (eg basin-wide cyclone).

The response of the Polarstern is shown in the two-frame animation and the csv
of its variables below. Note both the zonal and meridional drift components
were linear, with moderate drift to the north but a strong component to the
east, forming a large angle to the wind direction (which is counter-intuitive
but expected).

The ship presents a very large target to the wind but is of a negligible mass
compared to the larger ice pack. Mosaic has declined to make public the ship's
bearing (ie alignment with wind) over time, presumably to reserve for
themselves (in 2023) the capability of using the GFS forecast to make a few
days of ice motion forecast.

Attached also are the wind roses for wind direction and wind speed during the
229 hours of this low variability event.

<how ice drift correlates with wind direction>
For future reference, what was the offset angle during that period? It looks a
bit less than 45deg.

Looking under the ice, whoi itp102 is part of the mosaic buoy array, though not
currently featured in any animations yet, but it can be expected to experience
similar drift. The detail on the drift track is just about good enough to make
out the path we are all familiar with, also reminding us of the overall scale
of movement. Note the small change in temperature and senility as the buoy
possibly passes over roughly the same area. An enthusiast may want to look into
that ;)
The microcat is mounted at only 6m below the surface.

    ITP102 was deployed on a 0.7 m thick ice floe in the Transpolar Drift on
    October 10, 2019 at 85° 7.9 N, 135° 34.1 E in collaboration with the
    Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate
    (MOSAiC) expedition from the Russian Research Vessel Federov. On the same
    icefloe, a Naval Postgraduate School Arctic Ocean Flux Buoy (AOFB) and
    Seasonal ice mass balance buoy were also installed. The ITP includes a
    second generation prototype MAVS current sensor operating on a pattern
    profiling schedule including 2 one-way profiles between 7 and 760 m depth
    each day and SBE-37 microcat fixed at 6 m depth.

The polarstern position may possible be estimated to a higher degre of accuracy
than 1dp by calculating the mid point of p201 and p207. The correction to the
animation above(deleted) includes those calculated coords, shown in red. I
haven't been able to animate them along with the buoys yet.
Note how the drift track crosses over a similar area 3 times. Perhaps itp102
data correlates with that crossover point.
Tech note: Lat/Lon data is to 3 or 4 decimal places, rounded here for visual
reasons. There are still some overlaps.

Thanks Rog!  Music makes it easier to actually watch the path of ice movement
(and multiple times, to boot!).

Decades ago a classically trained friend did lots of improv playing, sometimes
like (for example) being influenced by the way leaves blew around outside
during blustery weather.  I imagine a computer program today basing 'music'
(okay, sound) on buoy movement direction, speed, changing buoy relations
(opening leads/growing ridges) [pitch, note duration, scale direction, volume,
other variables, other aspects of sound], put to harmonic (or at times
dis-harmonic) scales/chords.

Snow at the Remote Sensing Site at 86.13, 118.58 on Nov 26th, is still barely
over the birkenstocks and looking very susceptible to wind re-distribution.
Thermal insulation? Not really but maybe keeps the wind from sweeping heat off
the ice surface.

Meanwhile, back at the AGU blog collection, co-leader Matthew Shupe writes
about earlier equipment disruptions (but not about the big one on the 22nd):

https://blogs.agu.org/thefield/2019/11/26/
postcards-from-a-frozen-icebreaker-part-13/

https://polarbearsinternational.org/news/article-polar-bears/
polar-bear-questions-do-polar-bears-drink-water/

"11/14/19

But then in the following day, just after we performed the major power system
transplant on our L1 site, our L2 site failed. I examined all of the available
information, and it told me a story: The inclination of the system changed
abruptly by an angle that was ~3 times larger than the change from when Dave
and I climbed on a station together; at about this same time the sonic
anemometer instrument quit. The rest of the system’s communications went out
about 8 minutes later, just after a couple spikes in one of the shortwave
radiation sensors.

I speculated that this was a bear because the force exerted on the system must
have been about 3 times that of Dave and I, and the fact that things were
operating fine before and parts failed over the course of multiple minutes
instead of all at once. With our brief visit by helicopter today, it appears
that this speculation is true. It looks like the bear walked around the station
and first yanked on a cable to the sonic anemometer, shattering a metal
connector. He then jerked on a few other cables, totally pulling them apart and
breaking another connector that was inside our main box. He pulled on our met
mount, up at 2m height so he must have been standing on hind legs; this bent it
down to one side.

And then he found the good stuff: the exhaust from the fuel cell power system
is water. (As an aside, I wonder how bears drink water at all? I guess they
must melt snow). It looked like he was sucking on the exhaust, pulled it out
and chewed on a heat cable, mangling the copper outlet tube. This last part may
be the hardest to fix as we have spares of all the instruments and cables, but
will need to figure out a solution. All-in-all, it appears that, after another
major field surgery, we should be able to resuscitate this system and get it
operational again.

11/17/19 

It started small, as they all do. About 1m across at the point where the spine
road leads past Ocean City out towards Met City. The crack meandered and there
were places to easily just step across. No major changes over the day. We went
on with our daily work at Met City.

In the afternoon a couple of us went out to do some power line maintenance. As
it was there was little slack in our power network to accommodate cracks, so we
disconnected some of the power line straps and pulled available slack to the
area around the crack. Loops of heavy power cable sitting near the edge.

I estimated that it could absorb a widening to perhaps 20m. It held out well
beyond that, but in the end it still wasn’t enough. Saturday evening the crack
opened to >20m in places, then made a lateral shift of as much as 100m.

Met City, Remote Sensing site, and the ROV Oasis all moving more forward
towards the centerline of the Polarstern from the starboard side. A bit
reminiscent of the bid lead we had 22 years ago at SHEBA; that one moved our
camp 500m to the side and made it necessary to power the camp on generators for
the rest of the project.

But here, at MOSAiC, with this big shift, somehow Met City survives. It appears
to be crack free, all instruments standing, and amazingly the power is still
on! By Sunday morning there was a shear in the other direction, back beyond the
original connection point, opening, closing.

And finally coming to a rest at nearly the original starting point. Met City
power was finally interrupted at about 7am local time, its characteristic green
light going out. Sunday was a planned day off so no science activities on the
ice but the logistics team was still busy; they work very hard in support of
this mission.

By the end of Sunday, Met City is still standing but dark, and the 30m mast has
an odd tilt to it. Will have to explore that tomorrow."

The first product below montages five fragmentary scenes from AWI
mosaic_multisensor that suffice to show the entire drift to date; the composite
is then set over the S1B from today.

The motion can be described as two stalls connected by a rapid linear drift.
The Polarstern is continuing to drift 0.4º west at constant latitude in the
nine hours following the hour of the S1B scene. However it has not exited its
box into new lat/lon territory. Winds remain moderate at 9 m/s.

GFS sees retrograde motion for next 5 days: more tangling of the trail, no
poleward motion, west yes but south with that. Overall drift will be not
Fram-ward but rather towards western Siberia but not dramatically so. And
that's been the case for the subsequent 15 hours (though lat is not provided to
sufficient accuracy to follow southerly drift).

The actual latitude as measured on 41m resolution Sentinel is 86.16621 which
rounds to 86.2 but is notably less, namely 6 km to the south. The longitude is
117.09º which rounds to 117.1º so the AWIwx is wrong, probably from just
cutting off digits instead of rounding to nearest tenth.

  86.2  117.0  19-11-28  06:00  6  30  -28.5  1011.9
  86.2  117.0  19-11-28  05:00  6  40  -30.2  1012.3

  86.2  117.2  19-11-28  03:00  7  50  -31.1  1013.0
  86.2  117.2  19-11-28  02:00  8  60  -31.1  1013.1
  86.2  117.3  19-11-28  01:00  7  50  -31.2  1013.3
  86.2  117.3  19-11-28  00:00  7  60  -30.8  1013.4
  86.2  117.4  19-11-27  23:00  7  60  -31.2  1013.5
  86.2  117.4  19-11-27  22:00  8  70  -31.1  1013.7
  86.2  117.5  19-11-27  21:00  7  70  -31.1  1013.7
  86.2  117.5  19-11-27  20:00  7  60  -31.1  1013.7
  86.2  117.6  19-11-27  18:00  7  70  -31.0  1014.0
  86.2  117.7  19-11-27  17:00  7  70  -30.5  1014.1
  86.2  117.7  19-11-27  16:00  7  80  -30.2  1014.1
  86.2  117.8  19-11-27  15:00   

The close-up continues to show rapid evolution of the Mosaic floe. It appears a
lengthy lead has opened in front of the bow and partly frozen over. Challenges
continue in keeping off-ship equipment collecting data.

The diagram and spreadsheet below show a second method for accurately measuring
latitude and longitude of the white dot on S1AB that represents the location of
the Polarstern at the timestamp of the satellite image.

In the case of ship position near 86,120, the canvas is extended 4x 2713.6
pixels (1º of latitude) so that the North Pole is now in the image after
rotating -15º to bring the 120º meridian into the vertical. The distance and
angle are then measured from PS to NP which then provide, after some
spreadsheet trivia, the desired location results. The circle of latitude of the
ship can be drawn as well as supplemental meridians.

If the stack of 91 S1AB images from floe mooring to the present are aligned to
86,120 using the difference mode in Gimp, then all the high resolution lat,lon
can be read off in one operation from a common fixed center at the pole which
largely eliminates relative error. While the measure tool is fast and easy, it
is limited to 2 dp in angle measure accuracy.

Thus a better alternative is simply to record the x,y position of the
Polarstern relative to x,y  of 86,120 along with a virtual north pole. Then the
lat,lon can be calculated to arbitrary precision from basic trigonometry
without further photogrammetric measurements on the images and error assessed
by probing the effect of bumping x,y by a pixel each.

The main source of error is ambiguity of position of the point 86,120 within
the broad red geolocation swath provided by PolarView. The GeoTiff scene
variant provided would have precise geo-referencing but the file size of these
is enormous: 128 MB compressed which would likely scale to a terabyte for the
growing S1AB archive.

Better still would be hourly (or ten minute) GPS readings from the ship itself,
rather than 8 hr S1. All that has to be done there is for Mosaic to stop
obfuscating its release.

Update:  another image has just been posted, S1B 2019 11 28 T 0635

Does that mean you've already done it so we don't have to? ;) I need one
accurate starting point on, say, oct4 for a drift comparison test.

Looking at the close up S1AB's I think mosiac have really missed an opportunity
to engage an audience in real time. It looks like quite exciting ice movements
happen close to Polarstern. The sort of thing that interests webcam watchers
worldwide (waterholes, peregrine falcons etc). There's plenty of light around
the ship, where's the webcam???

Today's drift in slowmo so you can read the lat/lon and I dont have to label
anything.

    Mosaic news is a big yawn. Ineffective. People want excitement.

Right, Mosaic is putting people to sleep with boring staff photos. A web cam of
ridges crashing against the ship and scary leads opening and closing by the
gangway, time lapse with an inset of the captain's instrument panel (GPS,
pitch, yaw, bearing). Even an iPhone 6 can stream time lapse video with sound,
I have one set up at the bird feeder. A live cam would not make a dent in the
ship's excellent bandwidth.

    Does that mean you've already done it so we don't have to?

Yes it does (because it turns out to be rather easy).

PolarView does this very accurately in an unpromising display option called
'jpeg2000 file (lossy)' that does not download the selected scene to disk as
the icon suggests but rather opens a new tab running a plug-in (no installation
required) called NSJSView 1.0. It is reminiscent of Nasa Worldview but better
done.
 
While the ground resolution of S1AB is ultimately limiting, the remaining
measurement uncertainty now is where to put the dot on the fuzzy Polarstern
reflector. Here the ship beam axis and bow2stern crosshairs define a consistent
center and provide an estimate of error associated with mouse position being
off a pixel or two.

Nothing more is involved than finding the PS dot in each of the 91 S1AB and
capturing it with a screenshot that includes the lat lon to four decimals.
There seems not to be text capture in the contextual menu nor url change with
mouse position (unlike nullschool) so those numbers have to be entered manually
in the S1AB spreadsheet. (OCR will have problems with the '/' separator.) Gross
typos can be caught by comparing round-off to one decimal data already in the
db.

Rows will look like this (86.1642 116.9532 is the location of the 06:35 image):

S1A   2019 11 28 T 04:08 86.2   117.1   7   50   -30.9 86.1665 117.0933

So now we know where to put the dot and how big to make it on the Polarstern
viewed as a big buoy (not seeing). 

The 91 S1AB do not quite jib with the 1392 hourly buoy GPS data points. Here
the question is not how to interpolate -- R is statistical software offering
every conceivable interpolation method and goodness of fit evaluation -- but
whether to use the mosaic_multisensor track provided a couple of posts back, as
AWI may have used secret high precision PS location data in drawing the red
line.

In any event, it will be interesting to see how animated close-in P-type buoy
triangulations relate to these high accuracy S1AB location points. Outer buoys
will be affected to a greater extent because of additional remote transitory
leads and ridging. The attached csv provides the high precision lat lon
collected to date.

Maybe they're paying by the MB ;) Those Obuoy.org cams were interesting though,
and quite popular here. Who is going to be interested in 2023?

Thought about posting more buoy data but after a classic facebook breakfast
shot on https://follow.mosaic-expedition.org/ I'm going with this from bbc.

    Rammb down, line of dots?

IT will be back in Monday after a long weekend.

'Follow Mosaic' was better today but long is the transect, on what floe is it
located, what is its history and initial thickness, what have they found so far
-- none of your business apparently.

Hippocrates once said, you cannot walk the same Arctic sea ice transect twice
... was this floe representative, what commotion has the site undergone in the
last 60 days?

The location and date (but not the time, the exif was stripped) are given as
86.08 113.73 on the 29th. That would be well south of anywhere the Polarstern
has been recently. However if the Polarstern persists in using "ship time" and
changing that every Saturday (they say to better party with the incoming
icebreaker at its meal times), the date itself becomes problematic.

The last few days have seen a brisk sub-gale force wind (2nd column, m/s) from
a consistent direction pushing the ship steadily east with a touch of south.
The ship is at a record easterly position at 113.8 but at an unexceptional
latitude. Again, this is a great opportunity to study ice pack movement at a
constant stress vector.

Assuming the work party photo was taken at the same time as the last of the
four Sentinel-1AB this morning, the work site can be located approximately
using the fabulous new PolarView plug-in from bslmagb.nerc-bas.ac.uk. The exact
study floe cannot be determined because of the lack of timestamp on the photo.

drift update, 3 Pbuoys closest to PS, ~9days in 100frames.
This ani includes an estimate of PS location based on 10/17 distance between
p201 and p207. Some coordinates taken from polarview images have been added in
red to verify the rough path. The timing of the path passing close to the
polarview points still needs to be verified.
Tech  note: PS points in red taken from a list collated by A-Team using the
method here

    coordinates taken from polarview images in red and collated

Coordinates  were shared earlier from the 106 Sentinel-1AB images available
since the Polarstern moored on Oct 4th. These were hand-digitized using the
fast and accurate new PolarView plugin.

No new S1AB images have appeared during the last 48 hours, very unusual. It
means during all 16 orbital passes over the Polarstern, the sensors were either
shut down, malfunctioning, taking scenes in interferometric mode, or taking
images but suspending distribution. This happens every time the Mosaic floe is
encountering disintegration issues. Coincidence?

The P-buoys give the ship's position 2-3 times a day, always in the early
morning UTC hours. The accuracy is about a third of the ship's length. The
timestamps refer to nadir or satellite passage over the center of the scene.
While these are more accurate than we need (to the second), the minutes can be
anywhere between hours.

Like most buoys, the three close-in P-buoys call in their GPS coordinates 24
times a day, every half hour on the half hour. Since 4 dp accuracy is important
to measure ice pack deformation, the issue arises of how to best collate them
with the erratic timestamps of Polarstern S1AB images.

The Polarstern's lat lon is seldom co-temporal with the buoys, only 15 times
out of 106. However the other 91 can be linearly interpolated back to the
nearest half hour using the rate of change of lat lon. The ones below are
already synched to the buoys and do not need interpolation:

S1B   2019 11 29 T 0400   86.1220   115.0394

S1B   2019 10 07 T 0530   85.0846   134.3174

The Pbuoy dataset has various repairable glitches (shown below) not repaired by
the buoy owner; the month-old errors are simply passed on 'as is' to the
Meereis and sailwx portals to be ingested into Uniq's animation algorithm.

Since 94 - 12 - 3 = 79 other Mosaic buoys are currently reporting -- and some
of these will have glitches of their own -- there is a need to repair the
damage and regularize the data.

The best way to go is set up a master clock, say on the half hour back to the
beginning, then hang all the data off it to synchronize analysis. Although
Mosaic experiments often produce complex data types that don't fit in (below),
they still be indexed in if that serves some purpose.

For example, a source like GFS nullschool only reports at 3 hr intervals so has
gaps at 5 out of 6 positions, whereas sailwx and awiMet shipboard weather
report hourly. Ascat reports 3 times a day but swath timestamps are hard to
come by for the concurrent PS location. OsiSaf reports a rolling window of ice
movement every two days between 12:00Z. Most satellite products (such as Amsr2
ice concentration or cryo2smos ice thickness) report every 24 hours.

On these forums, we are looking for scalability, transparency, regularization
and portability:

Scalability: Any number of buoys or images can be tied to the master clock's
indexing field; indeed all put into a single common file. The issue is keeping
file size manageable over the course of the Mosaic year. If not, the latency on
common operations like 'sort' or 'fill down' becomes unworkable. The key here
is keep image collections such GFS weather pictures elsewhere, still indexed
though by the master clock.

Transparency: This means suppling the data in human-readable data or image
format such as plain txt, comma separated variables, netCDF, kml, gif, png, jpg
or mp4 visible in the post itself or as an attachment anyone with an old cheap
computer can download, open in free software and process for themselves. More
and more climate change sources are using arcane binary formats the average
person cannot work with.

Regularization: Errors, gaps and glitches should be repaired just once, rather
than 50 people making the same tedious repairs 50 times over. To a certain
extent, this is enforced by keying to the master clock. I will post repaired
P-buoys, synched S1AB and reconciled sailwx/awiMet in a bit.

Correction and collation of databases can be done very rapidly if you still
have a 25 year old Mac running MS Works 1.0; it has gotten much harder since.

Portability: The data should be immediately importable into other open software
for specialized projects, such as Excel, Gimp, ImageJ or R for statistical
analysis, charting, slide shows, animations and movies.

Co-leader M Shupe has an excellent new on-site blog out; note that despite the
Nov 27th tag the storm event being discussed only covers the 18-23 Nov 2019.
More has happened since then

We could see the damage just looking at S1AB time series but it is great to
have confirmation and  specific details beyond satellite resolutioon. Note
buoys are not on the Mosaic floe and may be affected differently or not at all.

I don't think things would have gone better had they selected another floe; the
ice was garbage everywhere at their latitude on Oct 5th and still is. Had they
gone closer to the pole, transpolar drift would have become even more
problematic than it is now: the GFS wind forecast translates heuristically to
more south and east backtracking of their trajectory.

    Postcards from a frozen icebreaker – Part 14
    By Matthew Shupe 11/18/19
    https://blogs.agu.org/thefield/2019/11/27/
    postcards-from-a-frozen-icebreaker-part-14/

    I was startled by the phone call shortly after midnight. Trouble at Met
    City. Felix had just arrived on the bridge for his night watch from 12-4am.
    He always takes a look around camp when arriving for his duties. And there
    was no 30m mast. Simply gone.

    We had seen the crack before, and apparently it got active and pulled on
    some of the guy lines, ultimately pulling the mast down. The sonic
    anemometer failed right away, possibly from just being unplugged. Upon
    later inspection it is bent, can likely be straightened, re-calibrated, and
    put back into operation.

    Our met sensor remained operational the whole time, including [while lying
    on the ground] after the fall. We will test both of these instruments
    against others, but it is looking like they will both live to see another
    field measurement.

    The mast itself might also be salvageable. Some bent legs the ship can
    likely fix and a few damaged sections that will just be taken out of
    service. Thus, it may become a 25m mast but that would be better than
    nothing. Now we just need the ice to settle down so we can think about a
    redeployment.

    The chaos has contributed to this feeling. Major ice dynamics running from
    the northwest to the southeast of us, across the bow of the ship. They have
    sheared our camp, and the Fortress, in half. This was part of a regional
    event with lots of ice motion, likely driven by a strong storm with very
    high winds.

    Initially the lead opened many meters across, followed by some shear with
    the far side of camp moving towards the ship, then away again. In the last
    days it all moved again perhaps 500m.

    Met City is almost directly in front of Polarstern while Ocean City remains
    approximately where it was (after a slight move to stay away from the
    ridge). A much longer daily voyage for us to get to Met City, and now it
    means bringing fuel cans to run generators. Met City is now very dark.

    “Continuity” is a very important concept for MOSAiC. But it’s also a huge
    challenge in the current Arctic conditions. In the last week we’ve had so
    much ice movement, right out in front of the ship. We watched Met City move
    back and forth across the view from the bridge.

    Intermittently we are able to reach it, going from floe to floe. While at
    other times there is no access possible. And this limited access impacts
    the continuity of our measurement on the ice. We are running Met City on a
    couple of generators but the runtime is such that we must refuel twice per
    day.

    Last night the ice movement left us no route to Met City so the generator
    fan went out at 4:30 am local time. This limited access is leaving its mark
    on the Met City data stream but others experiments are also impacted.

    Sampling sites have move further away or broken up entirely; the Ocean City
    hut had to be moved; the whole Remote Sensing installation will need to be
    relocated, and more. Continuity of the observations has definitely been
    compromised.

An outdated map of the Ice Camp layout was included, not attached below because
it is one we have seen before, now presented at a blurrier resolution. It does 
not show the layout of the cracks and ridges discussed in the post.

Once again there is nothing but 404's in trying to locate the original full
resolution file. Neither the new lidar elevation map nor ice bottom ROV imagery
have been released in any form.

Last time I wrote the help desk, they got back to me saying the ship could only
be contacted intermittently, even though we know today it had a 100 mbps
internet connection ever since leaving Tromsø.

The MOSAIC expedition was designed, funded and implemented on a simple single
basic assumption, namely that there would be a nice big thick solid floe that
would remain intact throughout the entire freezing season as it drifted around
the Arctic.

Re-reading the early posts, it is difficult not to conclude that the floe
chosen was the best of a very bad lot as there was no time left to look
further.

Barneo 2019 was abandoned.

Mike Horn and Borge Ousland have had and are having an awful time on their
little North Pole skiing expedition
Quote

    Horn lamented the changing sea ice: “[It] is not only shrinking in size,
    but it has also become younger and thinner in recent years. This causes the
    ice to break up and move a lot faster than it used to, which are two of the
    biggest challenges we have encountered so far.”


So perhaps the MOSAIC expedition's basic assumption no longer holds? i.e n
years too late?

Perhaps the methodology, i.e. continuous measurements on and of a single floe,
no longer reflects the polar winter ice reality?

Perhaps the new reality is continuous change as ice moves, breaks up, reforms
into different patterns?

Indeed. Late refreeze and rapid extent gain maybe has it's own problems. More
obvious stretch marks perhaps.  https://go.nasa.gov/35U33jv  nov27-dec2, ctr

The two adventurers are looking at very unfavorable ice movement for the next
four days that will take them north and west faster than they can walk. The
same thing happened to Nansen's foot party. The image below plots their nrt
position at 08:29 utc 02 Dec 19 over nullschool GFS.

The idea of rescuers reaching them by sailboat or bringing food on skis seems
very naive looking at the massively fractured ice leads (https://go.nasa.gov/
2raOaKW). The two are within helicopter range and discussing airborne rescue
before the winds worsen as predicted; visibility and pilot safety are
additional issues. 

The Polarstern lost a helicopter pilot in Antarctica a few years back with
multiple scientists injured.

It's not clear what to measure to show/not show the ice is shearing, compacting
and diverging more than it did, to what extents this year is natural and
unnatural variation off a weak 2018-19 winter, and whether the mechanical
properties of the ice have deteriorated.

We've previously looked at the August, September and early October history of
this floe. Basically it was newly formed from collisions and a barely
consolidated mess as late as the Oct 2nd S1AB. Still, what were they going to
do after eight years of planning and grant-writing. Wait for the ice to freeze
solid, then set up in the dark?

Up thread, I laid out Plan B options. The best idea is probably to pull in all
the remote equipment, set out more buoys from the relief icebreaker arriving,
draw up the ice anchors, squirrel the shp around make an open patch of water,
point the bow (where the key instruments are) into the wind to avoid the
massive air pollution affecting them now, and change locations under powered
drift.

Had a look at osisaf for today but it only goes back to 2015 and wouldn't be
representative (ctr). Is there a monthly drift somewhere that might give an
overview of possible increase in mobility over the years. (or average the
arrows over a month somehow?)

A month of meandering mosaic drift, nov2-dec3. Another acceleration yesterday.
~31days in 150 frames.

Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, owners of itp102, part of the mosaic buoy
network, give a nice overview of drift on their site and at the moment mosaic
align quite well with annual drift. https://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=165676

Yes. Put the three buoy lat lon columns in a spreadsheet, making sure their
half-hour time stamps are in register. Add the haversine formula (http://
mathworld.wolfram.com/Haversine.html) as 7th-9th columns to calculate sides.
Add a 10th column that sums these to a triangle perimeter. Use the SSS formula
sqRT (s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) with s the semi-perimeter for the area. Draw each
triangle using an online triangle tool, capture, bin-color in proportion to
area, float as otherwise transparent layers and animate. YES YOU CAN

The tool below will put your choice of inter-buoy distance along the bottom
rescaled to a constant length. Then you can see the relative shape change in
the other two sides.

    average the ice motion arrows over a month somehow

In the past we have tried loading the month as grayscale in gimp and using the
'average layers' command on a duplicated stack (image menu). That gives a so-so
wind rose at each grid point that could be compared year on year by image
subtraction to give a 2015-19 animation.

It may be that OsiSaf ill-advisedly puts the center of the arrow over the grid
point (as mosaic_multi does) instead of the tail. So we need to first redraw
the arrows with no heads using the OsiSaf netCDF than no one can get to work.
Alternatively Panoply (or command line) dumpNC would give numeric x,y values at
grid points or regions of interest that could be passed on to Excel which has a
good wind rose chart.

The next three days or so on GFS look like more of the same: moderately strong
winds at a fixed bearing. Below, the png assumes a mid-range coriolis angle of
25º of ice movement CW to the direction of the wind. Zonal and meridional
components r,θ = lat lon are shown for the 05:00Z nullschool of today roughly
scaled to the cube of 100 hPa wind speed from comparing response at periods of
constancy.

In three days time, my expectation is the Polarstern will drift to 86.2  121.9
(ie on 09:00 on 06 Dec 2019 according to sailwx tables). Thus 1/6th of the trip
will be over without any real indication of Fram-ward transpolar drift.

Sentinel coverage of the Mosaic floe has resumed. Daily instability suggests
very little of it is fit for purpose.

Technical note: nullschool provides a clean 1º graticule over land if wind is
set to none. AwiMet provides the green location circle. Setting the scale
parameter to 3000 maximizes resolution. Longitude has been increasing by 0.05
deg/day over the last 24 hours but latitude by only 0.005, setting the wind
scaling. (Mean recent change or tangent to the PS position curve could be
determined more accurately with high resolution S1Ab or buoy data.)

The tangent vector is set by rotating to vertical using the Polarstern's
current longitude, drawing a perfect horizontal, then rotating back. The wind
direction is drawn as the tangent vector to the radial vector of the osculating
circle to the curving wind sprite at the PS. Dropping the perpendiculars then
gives the desired breakdown of motion in terms of lat,lon. Here taking the
ratio of r,θ component vectors causes the wind scaling factor to drop out.

    take the time to get it right Tor.

Given the very small patch occupied by the three buoys, it would be ok to
forget the WGS84 ellipsoid and for that matter the spherical earth and just
work on its tangent plane at a buoy triangle centroid. So, using the buoy
positions as lat, lon = r,θ of plane polar coordinates = rcosθ, rsinθ (lat in
S1AB pixels, lon in radians) = x,y cartesian, it is a matter for high school
trigonometry.

What about using mean wind speeds from reanalysis as a proxy for ice motion to
make a month on month comparison to Nov 2019? That data is readily available
quite a ways back. We could wonder how accurate it is for the Arctic Ocean
given the near-total lack of instrumentation but that might not much affect
anomaly or trend estimations.

However wx'ers steer clear of near-surface wind wind prediction whereas that is
precisely where wind stress on the ice arises. And for that, ridges and floe
edges (aka freeboard, thickness) provide the primary frictional surfaces. How
much do we know about these even in the Polarstern year? Next to nothing.
Assuming they're the same defeats the whole purpose of the wind proxy: more
wind but less surface friction would look very similar to less wind and more
friction.

Three Sentinel-1B came in this morning. The Polarstern ducks being all in a row
already, there wasn't much to do (1st image) except translate them sideways to
tomorrow's prediction based on strong steady winds forecast at GFS-null.

The animation of the 3x close-ups do not indicate any rifting or ridging though
the turmoil continues on the Mosaic ice camp area (which was a jumble of
unconsolidated blocks to begin with). The faint white diagonal indicates the
direction of travel to left.

However the ship is entering an area in the anti-cyclone lee of SZ, suggesting
ridging if winds converge, or shear if wind speeds differ (4th image). Winds
faster than 14 m/s are considered gale force (table below). Use keyboard 'k' to
advance 3 hrs, 'shift-k' to advance 24 hrs on GFS:

orthographic=-45.00,90.00,3000/loc=118.600,86.100

We have no accurate way of placing the Polarstern (green circle) latitude
forward on GFS predictions, a significant issue given sustained wind speeds.

The Polarstern continues to drift very rapidly east (ie the wrong way) and
slowly north. The winds have been in the double digits for the last 61 hours,
averaging a 14 m/s gale force push at~50 km/hr. The direction of the wind has
been remarkably steady at 240º.

GFS-null shows this drift will continue for 2-3 days as the anti-cyclone center
elongates to the north as it dissipates. Wind vector constancy presents an
opportunity to determine the 'Nansen angle' of ice drift relative to wind under
these conditions and to predict Polarstern drift a few days out.

The issues here are the ground accuracy of GFS and the optimum scale for angle
measurements as nullschool. The url can be fed the nrt position data from
sailwx, currently 86.1  121.1  11:00   14  240. At maximum resolution, a
rapidly moving Polarstern moves noticeably on GFS nullscape.

Here position-specific daily (or 3-hour) urls at the time of S1AB, say 05:00z
can be manufactured by a simple merger of AWImet and any initial GFS url. It
would be great to have this back to the mooring date of Oct 4th at a couple of
scales as an mp4. Note gimp side panel thumbnails show high velocity winds at a
glance. Production at 3 hr intervals would require an automated procedure as 8
per day * 60 days * 2 scales = 960 is out of reach of manual methods.

The two new Dec 5th Sentinels show continuing turmoil within the Mosaic
experimental area. A relief icebreaker is on its way, sort of. There is
currently a 949 hPa cyclone in the north Atlantic between this ship and the
Arctic Ocean.

Quite a few scientists from leg 1 will be returning to shore. Leg 2 is seen as
the most difficult because of unrelenting cold, darkness and wind. It appears a
new communications officer is coming on board; that might help us stay better
informed.

It seems the Russian icebreaker, "Kapitan Dranitsyn" has now left port 
(Tromso) and is on its way.

It also seems it will divert, if necessary, to help getting Horn and Ousland
off the ice, and maybe rescue  the Norwegian research ship «Lance» which has
got stuck trying to get to the two men.

The whole ending strikes me as highly contrived, all about filming a meet-up
with two buddies and later them eating ribs and french chocolate. The Lance has
a helicopter pad but they are not using it so the adventurers will be able to
say they went boat to boat per the original plan.

The tent camp is also well within reach and capabilities of the Svalbard
helicopter service that extracted the crew from the grounding in the Hinlopen
Strait last December.

The Lance does not really have to chops for this job and keeps getting frozen
in the 30 cm ice but they are scripted to moor along an ice edge so the two do
not have to be seen being picked up from a zodiac even though they are having
to be rescued as they don't have the food or fuel to continue under current ice
conditions and more weeks of unfavorable floe drift.

There is a Norwegian icebreaker at the scene but they are not using it. The
Polerstern's relief icebreaker is not likely to be headed towards Svalbard --
way out their way and through more ice than necessary. These ships have all
turned off their GPS beacons; sailwx is only receiving the Polerstern's.

Updates -- and some pointed questions about an actual purpose for the trip --
can be found in the comment section at this Norwegian site which updates almost
hourly:

https://direkte.vg.no/nordpolen_ousland/news/5de62459d45a8b0011b1677f

Quote

    Just before Lance left Longyearbyen, a research ship also left north. I see
    on Marine traffic that this ship is on standby on the ice (on starboard
    side of Lance), probably be the new state-of-the-art icebreaker for the
    Norwegian Polar Institute, "Crown Prince Haakon" a research assignment in
    the area and can contribute if necessary. The name may be icebreaker Haakon
    Magnus "is located just to the east of you, can't they break a real trap
    for you?

    How much does it mean for the expedition to go "unsupported", which is not
    possible with post-supplies? And how do they manage to meet in the icy,
    dark and snowstorm. Even with GPS and satellite phones, this must be a
    major challenge. The two teams of polar explorers have agreed on a common
    point on GPS that they both are heading towards.

    Bengt Rotmo and Aleksander Gamme, friends coming on foot to the tent camp,
    have emergency rockets and a signal gun too, so they can use it to show
    where they are. There is a doctor on board the Lance though no issues are
    expected.

Some large scale north-south extensional fissures have opened up, a long 600m
wide crack to the east of the Polarstern and a (so far) smaller one right
through the Mosaic floe a few tens of meters west of the ship.

Even a small displacement in Ice Camp disrupts power lines, towers, generators,
experimental equipment and repair access. Here the lead is approximately 100m
wide (2-3 pixels on S1AB 40m).

This followed 72 straight hours of wind speeds in excess of 10 m/s at the
ship's location, attributable to its position in the north-central winds of a
persistent anti-cyclone centered in the New Siberian Islands.

On the next post, the relevant GFS nullschool sequence shows that sharp
curvature in the applied wind stress from the tightly coiled anti-cyclone was
incompatible with increasingly brittle ice, which then shattered along
north-south lines to accommodate to applied forces.

The 05:30 scene will apparently be the only S1AB today as the 07:00 orbital
pass was either not taken or suppressed. It is hard to believe that both A and
B satellites would have higher scheduling priorities at such an obscure
location during a dramatic moment in an historic Arctic expedition. Surely AWI
has closer connections to schedulers at ESA Copernicus than foreign
researchers; eight years of planning went into Mosaic.

In any event, we don't know if the 05:30 caught the beginning, end or middle of
the lead opening. It could be growing to the size of the one to the east;
alternatively it may have peaked earlier and now be closing. Previous images
show that this is not a new fault but rather reactivation of an older lead.

Note a second fissure comes in from the west (3rd image). This too has opened
and closed repeatedly over the last two months.

The final image shows a rare cloud-free swath of heat map of the area around
the Polarstern a few days back. The white lines are leads that, despite being
frozen over, still leak more heat to the atmosphere than surrounding thicker
ice and so are brighter when imaged in the infrared.

Neither lead can be attributed to the PS and AF icebreakers maneuvering about
during the initial mooring to the Mosaic floe, though we might wonder how the
relief icebreaker Kapitan Dranitsyn will get in close enough to refuel the
Polarstern.

Insulting official expedition communications from 'Follow Mosaic' feature inane
pictures of omelets and baked goods from the Polarstern kitchen, along the
lines of arranging deck chairs on the Titanic. Shupe's AGU blog, the only real
source of information, has not been updated since November 18th. It has a nine
day lag between its writing and its posting.

A new Helmholtz post on PS site mitigation appeared on Dec 4th but seems dated,
non-specific and smiley-faced about disruptive floe events, insuperable
problems obtaining data continuity over a year and tainting of air quality data
by the ship itself. (On past expeditions, the PS stayed pointed into the wind,
allowing fresh air to reach bow instruments).  One interesting point however
about wastewater:

Quote

    When it comes to the outlet for our filtered wastewater (technically clean
    water), a pump system was installed on Polarstern that reintroduces the
    salt previously removed from it, before discharging the water at a depth of
    ca. 150 m. The times at which these ‘dumps’ are made are documented,
    allowing any potential influences on them to be identified after the fact.


By far the best reportage is coming from Martha Henriques at BBC. The Dec 3rd
post links back to the others. Byron Bloomquist of CIRES NOAA is also posting
detailed damate reports.
https://mosaic.colorado.edu/blogs. AWI, the expedition lead, gives out no
information whatsoever.

https://mosaic.colorado.edu/blogs

Quote

    Markus Rex of AWI, expedition leader, shows me the trajectory of the drift
    so far on a screen in the Red Saloon, one of the ship’s common rooms. There
    is a pattern in the meandering line on the screen that shows one reason
    that cracks and pressure ridges have been appearing in the camp.

    “You see these cycles here?” he traces a line in the shape of a scalloped
    edge. “It’s fast here, then it’s always slow, slow, slow.” He stops at a
    pinch point on the line. “These are the points when we get the high
    pressure.” That’s when the floe is twisted and pulled in different
    directions.

    At least there is some predictability in these cycles but still, but as Rex
    watches the screen inside the Red Saloon, it’s clear that there is little
    the team can do but hope the damage to instruments and infrastructure each
    time won’t be too great.

To me it looks like the MOSAIC project has had some windy times but not a real

Perhaps they should, especially in this month.

Winter storms accelerate the demise of sea ice in the Atlantic sector of the
Arctic Ocean
Introduction
Quote

    The strongest storms in the Arctic Ocean typically occur during winter and
    originate from the North Atlantic Ocean1,2 (Fig. 1). The number and
    intensity of Arctic winter storms has increased over the period 1979–2016.
    These storms often generate strong southerly winds that transport heat and
    moisture into the Arctic from the mid-latitudes, contributing to record
    breaking winter temperatures.


https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7def
Extreme cyclone events in the Arctic: Wintertime variability and trends
Abstract
Quote

    Typically 20–40 extreme cyclone events (sometimes called 'weather bombs')
    occur in the Arctic North Atlantic per winter season, with an increasing
    trend of 6 events/decade over 1979–2015, according to 6 hourly station data
    from Ny-Ålesund. This increased frequency of extreme cyclones is consistent
    with observed significant winter warming, indicating that the meridional
    heat and moisture transport they bring is a factor in rising temperatures
    in the region. The winter trend in extreme cyclones is dominated by a
    positive monthly trend of about 3–4 events/decade in November–December, due
    mainly to an increasing persistence of extreme cyclone events. A negative
    trend in January opposes this, while there is no significant trend in
    February.

Below, a summary of weekly blog posts from Byron Blomquist, CIRES and NOAA. The
event this morning appears catastrophic even relative to earlier havoc at the
Mosaic floe. An update can be expected Monday. Dec 9th.

The scientists' persistence to stay operational under difficult weather and ice
conditions is only to be applauded but as with a poker hand, there is a time to
hold 'em and a time to fold 'em.

The event this morning may prove a tipping point. The original plan, conceived
eight years ago, is no longer viable in the ice of today. It is time for Plan
B.

GFS foresees a lull for the next five day: slow drift north but in the
direction of Ellesmere Island, not the Fram Strait.

https://mosaic.colorado.edu/news/weekly-update-byron-7

“December 2. The Dranitzyn left the coast of Norway yesterday to begin the
transit to our location and should arrive within a week to 10 days. AWI
estimates it will then take about 5 days to transfer ~50 tons of cargo between
the two vessels and pump over the fuel, weather conditions permitting. We were
not able to accomplish everything we planned for leg 1 having to overcome a
series of setbacks related to ice dynamics.

The route to Met City was reestablished over the past week and the main power
lines reconnected, so most of the instrumentation there is back on line. The
ship's machinists repaired damage to the collapsed 30m met mast and we hope to
reinstall it as a 23m mast sometime next week.

Air sampling from the bow is often good for several days running, then
unsuitable for several days as the wind direction shifts to the stern of the
ship.

The anemometers, CO2/CH4 flux system, fast ozone, slow ozone, NOx, GCMS, and
mercury instruments have all been running well. The DMS mass spectrometer ran
for a few weeks, but a power supply failure will keep this system off line
until leg 4.
 
Nov 25, 2019. The passage of two arctic cyclones last weekend was a unique
opportunity to make atmospheric observations of a poorly understood weather
system. There were no major shifts in the ice pack over the last several days
but the situation remains dynamic, with leads opening and closing on a daily
basis.

The remote sensing site has been dismantled and will be rebuilt at a new site.
The ROV site is partially operating on generator power. The Ocean City site was
dismantled and moved to avoid an ice ridge, but is mostly operational again.

The situation at Met City is tenuous. Met City is still without a power line
but instruments on the tower are operating part of each day on generator power
and we've been able to access the site twice daily to refuel. It is sometimes
possible to reach Met City by snow machine, but often access is by foot only.

The exact route changes daily, depending on ice conditions. Met City is
currently only about 400m from the ship, but the route over ice is probably
closer to 1 km. Our measurements there are still shutdown and we don't have a
good estimate yet for when the power and data lines will be reestablished.

After the large shift in the ice floe on 19 Nov, the Met City, ROV and remote
sensing sites moved about 600m to the SE, across the bow of the ship. Met City
is now located directly in front of the bow and the remote sensing site will be
reestablished in this same general area. Ice in front of the ship is now a
complex system of blocks and ridges. The ROV site is now off the port quarter
of the bow.

The formerly compact Central Observatory site now spreads over a much greater
area and the bow of the ship is largely surrounded by on-ice infrastructure. If
the ice solidifies in this state, this will be the arrangement for the
remainder of the project. This will impact the clean wind sector for
measurements from the bow of the ship, but there should still be many hours per
day with minimal activity on the ice.

November 15-17. A powerful winter storm blew through the scientific cities set
up on the ice around the ship. Intense winds tore new cracks in the ice floe
next to the ship, sending some ice-based instruments adrift. It’s possible that
the floe will drift back together and freeze again. I think about the word
“mosaic” and how it implies a breaking in order to be put back together.

Eventually the drift slowed down. The instruments moved in a U-shape around the
bow of the ship. ROV Oasis is now off to the left. Remote Sensing not far by.
Met City is directly in front of the bow. Ocean City and Balloon Town stayed in
relatively the same position, but a long lead opened directly next to their
tents.

The Atmosphere Team’s flux stations, part of the distributed network, are doing
great, overall, although we had one disruption that involved a polar bear. We
have snapped cables and a dismembered exhaust system to repair. We are working
to rig new connectors and cables, and have ordered a new exhaust pipe that will
hopefully arrive with the next leg of participants in December.

Due to a major storm in the last few days, we have also had lots of cracks
around the ice, and one has opened up so wide that in order to get to our
instruments, one has to use a kayak to cross to the other side.

The 30 meter tower has tipped over. An assessment of the instruments and damage
done to the tower are still on-going. Our other 11 meter tower is still
standing tall, but another smaller crack has opened beneath one of the
guy-wires that holds up the tower.

Nov 19, 2019. The last several days have seen some dramatic developments and
some setbacks.  On Saturday a strong arctic cyclone moved through the area,
bringing sustained winds up to 20 m/s for many hours, first in an westerly
direction, then veering to northerly. Our drift rate increased to > 0.5 kts to
the E and then to the S, at one point up to 0.8 kts. We are now well S of our
position a week ago and are once again on a track toward Siberia.

The large multiyear floe which was selected as the backbone of our Central
Observatory split in two on Sunday, with a significant shear zone developing
just in front of the ship in a port-starboard direction.

This lead has opened and closed a few times over the past 48 hours and the
shear between the two halves is currently offset by as much as 70-100 m. The
block with Met City, ROV City and the Remote Sensing Site are on the opposite
side of the crack and a large ice ridge is developing between Remote Sensing
and Ocean City.

The Remote Sensing site was heavily damaged by ice movement and a number of
large instruments were moved to safety on Sunday. The site will need to be
reestablished at another location when the situation stabilizes.

The power and data links to Met City and all other sites on the opposite side
of the lead were severed early AM on Sunday. Further ice movement brought down
the 30m met tower at Met City early this morning. Otherwise, most of the
equipment installed at Met City is intact and appears to be on stable ice, but
only a few instruments are operating, powered by intermittent backup generator
supply.

Our CO2/CH4 flux system at Met City is down and will not operate until ship
power is restored to the site. Met City was originally located about 800m off
the starboard beam of the ship at a 2 o'clock bearing, but as of today is
drifting toward the 1 o'clock position. Because the ice is still moving we do
not know when power and normal operations will be restored.”

    why we don't get open data from Polerstern / Mosaic?

I looked into a Freedom of Information request for the ship's log, gps location
and heading at ten minute intervals and so on. I have done these requests
before in the US, followed by successful but time-wasting lawsuits when
inevitably they don't comply.

This probably wouldn't go anywhere with NSF grantees like Shupe and Blomquist
who are already posting quite a bit of timely disclosure in their realms. The
US kicked in $26m; grants will be monitored.
Now a FOIA could get some BS stonewalling such grantees have a right to first
use of experimental data, at their leisure (ie 2023 in Mosaic planning
documents).

However after much commotion, NIH at least requires immediate disclosure in
genomic DNA sequencing. There, a robotic sequencer ftp's its reads directly in
real time to a public web archive, just like the 92 Mosaic buoys do today
including those of AWI.

Here Mosaic is doing shotgun environmental sequencing and any US grantees would
fall under compliance obligations. The original rationale was human health
research should not be delayed; the same could be said of planetary health.

Germany/AWI of course does not fall under US domestic law but they may have
something similar on the books. AWI presumably owns the navigational
instruments on the bridge; on previous expeditions -- but not here, no
explanation --  has always published a detailed weekly Polarstern report. It
would probably take a filing from a German citizen or reporter to meet the
requirement of standing.

What gets me is the deliberate dumbing down of the Polarstern's GPS location.
That required a deliberate decision to actively intervene because in factory
default mode and in actual onboard use, the instrument would be sending 5
decimal points instead of one. No one navigates through Arctic sea ice on 1 dp.

It all reminds me of the EA189 engine at the center of the Dieselgate scandal
that continues even today with the successor EA288.

We are to believe that AWI and 600 polar scientists were surprised to learn
upon arrival that the best floe around was only 30-50 cm thick instead of 1.2m.
Oh sure.

A satellite unknown to science measured ice thinness during late summer but got
it wrong? They made that one up.

A $150m experiment and they didn't have an old tramp steamer out there in late
August drilling floes? Not to be believed.

Russianss ran 5 tourist trips to the north pole in late summer but didn't tell
AWI partners about ice conditions or why they pulled the plug on Borneo? Highly
implausible.

AWI knew perfectly well in advance about the problems ahead, just like VW knew
about its NOx problem. Why else would you turn off ship beacons and dumb down
its GPS upon leaving port?

Translation of the Arctic Drift Podcast #7 - Sturm
Release Date: 03 Dec 2019

STORM

<Narrator>

Arctic drift,  the audio log book.

The first big storm has afflicted the MOSAIC expedition in the Arctic. The ice
camp around the icebreaker Polarstern was exposed to a hours lasting storm with
wind speeds up to 9 (Beaufort scale). The head of expedition Markus Rex talks
about the repercussions of the storm.

<Markus Rex>

Yes, last weekend we had our first big storm with harsh wind speeds up to 20
meters per second. Such a hefty blow. While the storm was forming we could see
that a big crack developing but then the sight was too bad to see it. The next
night the storm had clearly left some marks on the ice. The crack that
developed the night before was now a shear zone, a fault zone with smaller
floes and pieces of ice. All of a sudden, the whole other half of the camp
magically drifted with high speed eastwards. It looked like a train scrolling
by. First ROV city, then remote sensing site, then MET city passed the bow and
then they vanished in the dark. This is, of course, a drastic event for our
camp. After 600 meters offset it stopped.

<Narrator>

Because of the storm and the offset of the ice also the route of drift has
changed. The Polarstern is still frozen to an ice floe and moves without its
own engines.

<Markus Rex>

Since the storm, we moved north towards the pole but we will have westerlies
according to the forecast. Which means that we are moving along the western
part of our drift scenario. This is all still in a margin where we feel good
about but we would like to come north more quickly. The overall way we made so
far is in the upper expected range.

<Narrator>

Also, the infrastructure of the camp is partly damaged. Power and data cables
are cut and need to be repaired. Until this is done fewer data can be gathered.

<Markus Rex>

Since the shear zone moved right through our camp and cut power lines, we
installed emergency generators to power the equipment. But we are on a reduced
measurement schedule. We are now in the process of developing a new town plan.
We know what should be located where now and in the next days after we see some
stabilisation we will deploy the new power and data infrastructure.

The future town plan will differ from what we have now. At the moment all the
sites are in a linear line along the ice and a pressure ridge easily to protect
with a tripwire against polar bears. We will though, out of necessity, have a
radial layout in the future. This will be harder to protect against polar
bears, but this is what nature has given us and we will live with it.

<Narrator>
Even though the negative aspects of this storm are plenty, there are also
positive ones. Never before where measurements made from the inside of an
Arctic storm so intensely.

<Markus Rex>

From a science perspective, such a storm is a thrilling event. This is why we
are here. We want to find out how the weather systems in the Arctic work
together. We have complete measurements of multiple parameters from before,
during and after the storm. Energy flow, heat flux,  snow thickness, radiation,
what it did to the ice. This is a unique dataset and we are amazed when we look
at it. This will allow us to improve weather models. Yes, it's problematic that
we will have a new town layout and that we have to rebuild a lot, but this data
is what we are here for.

<Narrator>

Fortunately, there are parts of the camp that are undamaged and work fine.

<Markus Rex>

The storm has affected almost all of our sites but one. The core of our
observatory, the Balloon town, which we call the town hall, is still in the
same place and can be used as before even though the landscape has changed
dramatically. We now have a big pressure ridge in the background and a crack in
the ice behind it. I would say this has become a very attractive site with
direct water access and mountains. And we can still launch our balloon.

The balloon can, of course, only be launched with moderate wind speeds, so
during the storm, the balloon took no measurements.

<Narrator>

And again, this week a polar bear family visited.

<Markus Rex>

A mother with her two almost adult curbs came by. They tripped over the wire
which caused two flare bombs to start. That startled them a little and the
mother became cautious. They circumvented the camp in a wide bow and they did
what they are supposed to do - move along in the dark. But while they were near
one of the curbs couldn't resist exploring everything it could. It tried to
overturn every flag and play with everything. The mother returned a few times
to collect the imp. The other curb stayed with the mother all the time. You
could see the curbs were only one year old but had their own personality
already.

<Narrator>

When the work is done, the scientist have time for personal activities. May it
be sports or just watching northern lights.

<Markus Rex>

Friday night we have opened the ice for personal use. Some played with the
frisbee disc,  a soccer game took place, some went off with skis and made a
tour. Of course, it was black outside, but a black with a few northern lights.
We are too far north to see plenty of them, but sometimes we have them.

I think you are doing a very valuable job making this information on Mosaic
accessible to the English-speaking world. If you can't manage to do it in
future, let me know. I'm an English native speaker, but I'm fluent in German.

Well, the translation took more time than i anticipated. I wasn't too sure i
can keep it up like that. Perhaps a list of bullet points is easier to do and
gives the reader the same Infos.

The new one (episode 8 ) is in my podcatcher now and i planned to translate it
tomorrow in the bullet list form. If you want to do the next one (episode 9)
that would be cool. I can help of course if you want. :)

That would be the 03 Dec 19 podcast though which of several storms is hard to
say. Note 'pressure rig' translates to 'pressure ridge'. The follow-up 'Nach
dem Sturm' is dated Dec 6th but I am quite certain it does not address the
worst storm yet of the same date.

https://www.podcast.de/podcast/708698/

We remained throttled down to 1 Sentinel per day out of the 8 daily orbits
passing over the Polarstern. Today the ship was just barely included on the far
eastern edge of the 02:45 image. The Mosaic floe is so distorted after the
massive lead openings seen at 05:30 the previous day that it is hardly
recognizable, though its identity is certain from neighboring floe context.

This event likely undid much their previous ice camp restoration as well as
bringing all kinds of new disruptions. The weather will be very mild the next
five days so there will be an opportunity to catch up. However, going by past
years, there is no reason to believe this will be the last severe anti-cyclone
of the winter, on the contrary (see gerontocrat #368 above).

The ice is slowly getting thicker according to the 4 Simb3 buoys which might
help subdue ice dynamics at the Ice Camp. As the ice becomes more brittle with
deeper cold, that will change the character of disruptive events to less
plastic fractures.

The two images below show what has happened. As noted above, the ship was
situated at a hairpin of sharp wind curvature; the stress was too high at
prevailing wind speeds for rigid ice to go with the flow.

I am seeing a lot of misunderstandings about ice advection in the Arctic Ocean
on the part of the atmospheric physicists. Going north will never get them to
the Fram Strait on the expedition time frame because a gigantic immobile block
of multi-year ice is in the way.

They need to drift west to catch the circumpolar drift ('around') which is too
often confused with less frequent transpolar drift ('across'). Flow has largely
been zonal in recent years, not meridional (over the pole). Last year's
displacement of the FYI/MYi boundary line was somewhat exceptional, with ice on
the NP-Wrangel line passing over the pole (but not getting far).

So far this year, ice in the central Arctic is just milling about, the
Polerstern's aimless drift is representative of a far larger region. You can
see this just animating Ascat masked by Amsr2; we have that on another forum
for the last nine complete years.

That one is a mirror image, an old conceptual layout. We do have the original
site plan from the 126 page planning document up-forum as well as a later
as-built map in radial coordinates centered on the ship. We also have the
modified site plan they just released up-forum; it is no longer radial and
quite blurry at all the places it has been posted.

None of these maps are at all appropriate to the pending redeployment of the
Ice Camp -- if there is one -- after yesterday's big rearrangement.

Rapid drift to a grinding halt for direction change. Almost a handbrake turn.

edit: added a drift comparison. Spatially quite similar though one or more
buoys appear to temporarily race ahead during the more rapid drift. It's
possible that could be an artifact of generating the animations separately
though.

Not so sure about that - no storm but windy enough for discomfort given the
parlous state of the floe & environs?

Nullschool says 30 kmh wind tomorrow.
Gradual reduction over the next few days to 20 kmh and gradual direction change

Maybe but there is no double digit velocity in sight on GFS (the hourly ship wx
uses m/s). All the major events so far have been at sustained gale force winds,
14 m/s or 50 km/hr.

Since the last S1AB, the ice has presumably had a chance to consolidate because
of the calmest conditions yet of the expedition.

That's because wind stress on the ice is not linear but grows roughly as the
cube. So upcoming 7 m/s winds forces will provide only 1/27 (4%) the stress of
peak 21 m/s winds seen so far.

In order to use 3-hour nullschool wind, the future position of the ship won't
be at where it is today so the wind reading will be at the old location isn't
applicable unless the new location can be predicted and the green circle
repositioned.

However the main thing to look for at GFS nullschool is uniformity of the wind
currently coming up in parallel constant-color sprites from the south. It is
really abrupt changes in direction, speed and above all, curvature, convergence
and divergence of the sprite lines that forecast ice disruption.

In other words, look at time series deltas using the 3000 scale in HD (high
density) at the most recent ship wx position. It is these cyclones passing
overhead that really check all the boxes.

Right now, the most up to date GFS with known PS position shows elements that
would be problematic for the Mosaic floe, just not at very low wind speed.

Best practice with nullschool is to embed the url and popup in the image itself
which just takes a couple of clicks past the screenshot.

As we've seen, not a day goes by without some apparent rearrangement of the
recently formed ice jumble of the Ice Camp. Some of this may be attributable to
satellite viewing angle or changing surface salinity rather than actual ice
movement.

Pressure ridges and open leads are not always within satellite resolution. For
example, a 10 cm crack and slight shear that took down the met tower guy wire
is not observable on Sentinel.

Further, we don't know anything about current sensitivity -- is the floe so
damaged now that it is preconditioned to the point that minor ice stress now
has an effect?

Sometimes obscure changes at the Ice Camp cause major damage while major
upheavals might not actually affect experimental areas. I wonder how much those
onboard know about real time floe distortion away from the ship -- we are too
high but they are too low for a good view.

They have done two fly-overs with lidar that we know of; only one was released
but with flattened overlays. Otherwise it is dark and no one is allowed off the
safety perimeter, all the more so since it had to be linearized.

While the ship does have forward-looking ice radar on the bridge, being moored
on the starboard side with the Ice Camp at right angles and more to the ship
axis may block a full assessment. In any event, none of that radar has been
streamed our way despite the ship's fast internet. Mostly they are concerned
with continuity of data collection.

That hasn't been great to date despite incredible efforts to keep instruments
up and running.

Secondarily, they are concerned about evolution of a single floe over a year.
That is already off the table as an attainable objective.

Translation of the Arctic Drift Podcast #8 - (Nach dem Sturm)  After the Storm
Release Date: 06 Dec 2019

<Narrator>

Arctic Drift, the audio log book.

<Markus Rex>

In the last weeks, we've made some circles around here. We moved north, south,
west, and east but netted not much way. At the moment we are on the move
towards north-east which we like. This puts us back towards the middle of our
drift corridor. From here on it will likely, and averaged over weeks, going
forward towards the north pole.

<Narrator>

The MOSAIC expedition survived the storm that haunted them last week. In the
meantime the infrastructure was rebuild and the scientists can do measurements
as usual. The camp is a whole science town on the ice. The different science
teams are assigned to different parts of the town. It's like districts. The
site expands over several kilometres on the ice around the icebreaker
Polarstern.

<Markus Rex>

As you know the hefty storm last week has caused some damage. The layout of our
town has changed. Power lines were cut which forced us to switch to power
generators causing the measurement equipment to not work fully. But we've built
new ways and streets with provisional bridges to reach all the locations
safely. We use pulks to overcome smaller cracks. We have reached a certain
stability and are back in the game. Also, the 30-meter tall meteorologic mast
that fell during the storm will be rebuilt soon.

<Narrator>

The first phase of the expedition has almost concluded, which means that soon
the first big swap of science personal and material will happen. Many of the
scientists that are on the Polarstern since the end of September will leave the
ship, new crew members will come aboard. At the moment icebreaker still can do
the job of supporting the ship and swap people.

<Markus Rex>

The members of the first phase of the expedition will soon go home and a new
team arrives. This happens via the Russian icebreaker Dranitsyn which left
Tromsø on 27th of Nov. They had to wait out a storm on the northern coast of
Norway though. Tomorrow night they are expected to leave their fjord. Travel
time for them will be around ten days. The exchange of freight will take a few
days and then they will already be on their way back.

<Narrator>

In the future such swaps have to be done via aeroplane. The ice is getting
thicker by the day and soon no ship will be able to reach them. In the next
week, a runway will be built.

<Markus Rex>

For the first time, the ice has reached a kind of stability that you can
consider building a runaway on it. The focus is on smaller planes right now so
that you can evacuate people should there be a medical emergency. I checked the
ice today and i think i found a suitable location. I think we will have an
emergency runaway very soon. In the spring we will build it so that even bigger
planes like an Antonov can land normally and not only with skis.

<Narrator>

Wintertime in the Arctic doesn't only show in the growing ice thickness. While
you see a lot of animals in the summertime, during the winter you only see them
infrequently.

<Markus Rex>

The central Arctic in winter is a rather lifeless region. Normally, when you
are on an expedition to the Arctic ice, you are seeing plenty of species. You
see birds in the sky and seals on the ice all around in both of the Arctic
regions. But now, here in the central Arctic during winter it's actually dead.
Over weeks we don't see any animal and the ones we see are polar bears. But
just recently a very cute polar fox with his black button eyes, white fur and
that bushy tale came by, inspected things nervously but then quickly moved on. 
It's not clear what their diet is. Often time polar foxes follow polar bear and
nourish from what their friends left behind. Of course, we watched out for the
foxes big bear friend but we couldn't see any. And since the fox was gone so
quickly we assumed he followed his friend to not lose him.

<Narrator>

In the next episode, you'll learn when the next crew members will come on board
and who the next navigational chief is.

This :) was written on Nov 27th but dated Dec 6th and does not address the most
damaging storm of the trip on 03-06 Dec 2019. Pulks are sleds being used along
with wooden palettes to bridge small leads. Presseisrücken are pressure ridges.

Co-leader Shupe is now over two weeks overdue on his weekly blog. Cires is not
blogging the storm, Helmholtz quit in mid-October. Not substantive use is being
made of twitter.

No news is a variant on fake news and historical revisionism: if they don't
report the Dec 6th storm, it didn't happen. (Those satellites are sooooo
annoying: 4 S1AB scenes today + clear Terra Modis.)

Quote

    we will have an emergency runaway very soon. In the spring we will build it
    so that even bigger planes like an Antonov can land normally and not only
    with skis.

I sincerely doubt this looking at increasingly disheveled Mosaic floe which has
not stabilized since the Dec 6th storm. Rex doesn't indicate where this runway
will be located nor how thick the ice is; in the original plans, this was to be
bladed by Piston Bullies in the flat dark areas (former melt ponds). However
Mother Nature got there first.

If he is looking for volunteers to drive the bulldozers out on thin ice, like
at Borneo, i am opting out. Surely Rex knows how slowly and unevenly ice
thickens in the autumn; if not, a quick look over the ship's 100 mbps internet
at the nearby Simb3 ice buoy graphs suffices. Those show 1.254 m snow + ice
today -- the ice thickness they expected at mooring on Oct 5th some 66 days
ago.

https://www.cryosphereinnovation.com/387850

The Polarstern is looking at five days of inconsequential wind not strong
enough to do any more damage. The ship will drift a bit north from its present
record of 85.3º N but also a bit east from 121.2º E. We don't know at this
point whether the weather will be calm or windy when the relief icebreaker
arrives.

The Kapitan Dranitsyn's call sign is UCJP; the other numbers are IMO 7824405
and MMSI 273138300. We will be following the ship closely to see how much
unavoidable damage and ridge/lead preconditioning it does in approaching the
Polarstern. However it last reported on Dec-03 at 11:30 UTC, meaning it turned
off its new state-of-the art navigation beacon after heading up from Murmansk.

This accomplishes nothing for Mosaic because we can still see the ship's stacks
and tracks on Sentinel and RAMMB infra-red.

https://www.sailwx.info/shiptrack/shipposition.phtml?call=UCJP

Contrary to their inept static drift model, this is not favorable for reaching
wind fields that would bring them towards the Fram Strait. At high latitude,
the ship will never get past that gigantic immobile block of MYI documented in
the previous post.

The Polarstern is currently 1477 km from Svalbard whereas at mooring on Oct 4th
the ship was 1646 km away on Oct 4th. If this rate keeps up (it won't), it
would take 579 days drifting on a WGS geodesic (won't happen) to reach
Longyearbyen (won't happen in 2020-22).

I've attached the updated archive of S1AB images of the Mosaic floe. In
addition to timestamp, rough and precise lat,lon, wind speed, wind direction
and ship temperature each entry has direct links to both GFS nullschool and the
jp2 image at bslmagb.nerc-bas.ac.uk/iwsviewer/. The former is built out of the
preceding variables; the only technical tricks involve nullschool using lon,
lat order and rounding odd times down (eg 02:59 to 00:00) which is easily fixed
with modular round-off relative to the 3-hour spacings (eg 01:31 to 03:00).
That's MROUND(RIGHT(timestamp,4),300) in your spreadsheet.

It's quite feasible to add thumbnails of the Mosaic floe, P-buoy tracks and
regional wind the Polarstern is experiencing to each timestamp row in the S1AB
database without growing file size too badly. A better alternative might be to
make a mp4 at various scales out of every 3-hour nullschool GFS since mooring
and flash those that have associated imagery.

This ani runs at approximately the speed that it was written. Lat/Lon and
distance to 4dp for enthusiasts to check. No coloured lines. Fortunately it's
not equilateral so it should be obvious, for now, which distance is which.

Tech note: I think there is still an issue with the animation timing. Some of
the distances are very accurate, others are just close. The distance calcs are
done separately (finally found mapply) before the ani so I think some frames
show distance from an adjoining line of data. Could go back to Octave where
there is full control of the ani (but no projection as yet) or investigate
other R ani options. Reducing accuracy to 2dp would probably cover it though

hav.dist <- function(long1, lat1, long2, lat2) {
  R <- 6371
  diff.long <- (deg2rad(long2) - deg2rad(long1))
  diff.lat <- (deg2rad(lat2) - deg2rad(lat1))
  a <- sin(diff.lat/2)^2 + cos(deg2rad(lat1)) * cos(deg2rad(lat2)) * sin
(diff.long/2)^2
  c <- 2 * asin(min(1, sqrt(a)))
  d = R * c
  return(d)
}

Nice! Note that the GPS is to five decimals, unlike the one that Mosaic shares.
Still no history at Sailwx after Dec 3rd. Cruise Mapper only works in certain
browsers (such as Mac Chrome but not Mac Opera). Mousing around on the lat,lon
bar does move the ship around but the time associated with that move is not
shown. What time there is, is "local time" in the middle of nowhere, not utc!
That might be either Murmansk or Tromsø.

On a cruise ship, meal times are in local time. The Polarstern also does not
keep utc but instead it has been walking it back so as to synch mealtimes when
the KD arrives.

This is great that the two ships are already on the same tile at Polarview. I
don't see a bright dot yet for the KD but it should be down there. The captain
has 35 years of icebreaker experience so is no doubt taking the easiest route.

GFS shows good weather for the rendezvous, the first real break Mosaic has had.
No way could they transfer all that diesel with km wide leads opening and
closing. The Polarstern is moving north somewhat left of the wind which may be
attributable the deflection by the massive ice pack and fixed CAA islands
ahead.

Nice spotting. It is on all three Polarstern S1AB today, including the
PolarView plug in with its precision lat lon mouse-over.

Rendezvous weather five days out remains bland. The Polarstern will be more or
less in the same position it is now. The personnel there now will have ample
time to have equipment deployed on the ice brought back into working order
before turnover (to the extent that's possible).

The white dot seems to be in the wrong location(?). The KD is not preceding due
north as shown but rather mostly east on the other side of 120º.

Thx, Jayw! It seems like the second latitudinal circle is not 86º as I thought
but maybe 87.5º? (Best to have two  of each labelled for scale.) Indeed the PS
has had a strong tailwind from the south.

Is there any meaning to the tumbling of the Polarstern image, or just variable
cloud cover obscuring part of the heat source? (The Kapitan Dranitsyn steps are
quite big as it is under steam.)

The bottom Lagranian/Eulerian double animation of the 4 S1AB today does not
indicate major changes in the ship's orientation that could explain tumbling
though the Mosaic floe seems to change quite a bit despite steady conditions.

It can very much be affected by 'action at a distance' elsewhere in the ice
pack. That is, the area including the Mosaic floe is seen moving due north for
several days but there is already thick ice between it and the CAA -- where
does it go?

The 06:45 S1B came in ... it seems to show rapidly disappearing tracks relative
to the three S1AB composite back in post #396. How much of the non-linearity is
due to the KD following a favorable path through the ice and how much is due to
ice shifting and shearing over five hours?

JPSS/SNPP is by default a little wobbly. There seems to be an alignment issue.

Atmospheric turbulences could be another reason.

The Kapitan Dranitsyn is making surprisingly good time and on the S1B  04:00
this morning was only 112 km due south of the Polarstern. On the S1B 0538, the
frozen-in Polarstern had passively drifted a slight distance north and west
whereas the KD was actively underway as well benefitting from the same drift.

Since we have two lat,lon for the two ships from two satellite images 1.633
hours apart, it can be  calculated (haversine) that the KD has closed in on the
PS 10.6 km in that time which suggests it is preceding rapidly in thin ice and
would rendezvous in 15.6 hrs except that thicker ice will slow it down but
still 24 hrs seems reasonable.

GFS nullschool has a different updated forecast, showing the Polarstern on the
edge of an anti-cyclone centered in the Chukchi for the next few days. If so,
winds will pick up somewhat and drift will less towards the pole and more
(unwanted) drift east (yellow arrow). This represents less than ideal but still
manageable conditions for docking and fuel, equipment and personnel transfer.

The KD will likely dock alongside but outside of the Polarstern which is moored
with the starboard side along the Mosaic floe. The involves circling around
from the east so as not to create a trail of fractured ice that would later
affect leads and pressure ridges in the experimental area.

    thicker ice will slow it down

Based on the ice mass balance buoys in the area it doesn't look like the ice
will present much of a challenge. It's of some concern that the ~1m ice at
386850 doesn't appear to have thickened much at all.

    drift update, a new northerly record?

Yes. Just paste the whole raw non-tabbed page into a database and sort
descending, the northern most latitude will pop to the top since it is on the
far left. However from five day GFS, drift will be mostly back east and south.

86.6  120.5 19-12-11 16:00    7  170    -26.1
https://www.awi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/MET/PolarsternCoursePlot/
psobsedat.html

For the 128 S1AB times to date, the winds, heading and temperature statistics
to date:

ave   7.8  137  -18.6  85.7474   122.9168
max   17   360  -3.9   86.4748   135.8584
min   2     10  -30.9  84.7617   113.0207

Hopefully we can get all caught up in our tracking endeavors at the time of
transition from leg 1 to leg 2. The Kapitan Dranitsyn may be bringing a whole
new batch of them.

We need a dedicated buoy adopter like in days of old. It was easier with 1-2
buoys, now it is a swarm. No more expesnive Mosaics after this; from here on
out it will be more, sturdier, smarter buoys. By the tens of thousands if
needed.

The overall situation with buoy monitoring is complicated. Meereis Portal does
not keep up at all; IABP is more comprehensive but has strange reporting
practices -- buoys appear and disappear over time whereas once a buoy is
deployed and working it should only drop onto the non-reporting list of dead
buoys, never be deleted.

Below the old Oct 31 buoy collection is reconciled with a new Dec 11 download.
Of the 96 buoys currently listed, 15 are dead (have not reported in over a
week). A disproportionate number of these were set out by AWI:

The Kapitan Dranitsyn was not where I had expected it to be this morning but
rather well east of the 120º meridian where the Polarstern sits becalmed at
86.6º. Still the KD track is almost to 86.0º so it has some 65 km to go.
Location data from cruise mapper do not agree with the Sentinel track. The
course of the KD stands out best on the 05:30 S1A:

http://bslmagb.nerc-bas.ac.uk/iwsviewer/?image=DataPolarview/
111_S1jpeg2000_201912/S1A_EW_GRDM_1SDH_20191212T053019_F6E3_N_1.8bit.jp2

The KD may have other assignments such as retrieving moorings or placing/
servicing buoys and other instruments. Its mission was initially said to be 5-6
weeks, quite a bit more time than needed just for a refueling and crew swap.

Mild GFS weather the next five days will facilitate the KD's refueling task. No
significant drift will be taking place through Dec 15th. The current ice
thickness averaged over ~25x25 km is 1.41 m according to cryo2smos
observational product. Specific micro sites will vary.

    To avoid damaging the research camp during the resupply missions Kapitan
    Dranitsyn will drop anchor several hundred meters away and pump fuel to
    Polarstern using heavy-duty hoses. The remaining supplies and the
    researchers’ equipment will be hauled to camp on sledges pulled by
    snowcats. On her return journey, Kapitan Dranitsyn will take any waste that
    isn’t suitable for Polarstern’s special litter-incineration system... Fuel
    depots for long-range helicopters have been set up on Bolshevik Island but
    are not expected to be used... Mid-June 2020, the Swedish research
    icebreaker Oden handles exchanges .... The new Chinese icebreaker Xue Long
    2 is assigned mid-August resupply.

Fabulous! The hairpin turn coincides with what we know from Sentinel imagery to
be the most disruptive event of the trip. So far, it has gone unreported from
the Mosaic camp; with all eyes now on the KD refueling, trip home, and a lull
in the weather allowing repairs, it will probably never get reported other than
in distant memoirs.

Continuity in data collection is quite important for some but not all
instruments. The issue is not a few missing hours but rather permanent loss of
experimental equipment and abandonment of deployment sites. Mosaic costs some
$280,000 a day so loss of a million-dollar sensor is just a rounding error; the
problem comes with the logistics of replacing it (or not).

The animation below cuts to 34 critical hours centered on the hairpin and adds
available S1AB imagery, hourly weather data from sailwx-assisted awiMet (which
is quite gappy as usual), plus revisited (but not reanalyzed) GFS wind motion
links keyed to the hourly and PolarViewer links keyed to the S1AB.

The questions here: what caused the severe motion in and around the ice camp,
to what extent were they local, regional or whole ice pack in scope, and could
they have been anticipated from the GFS forecast?

Round-about route the last day as the going got toughter but docking as
expected to the east of the Polarstern on the 05:31 on Dec 13th. The Kapitan
Dranitsyn is still moving into position between 03:43 and 05:21. The 07:00 S1B
just misses in its coverage.

The tracks have to be captured within 24 hrs on a S1AB or they become all but
impossible to follow.

The large extended black lead to the south (up) is an unexpected overnight
development but so far seems to have no effect on fueling or Mosaic ice camp
equipment. It is not notably active between 03:43 and 07:00. There is no sign
of it yesterday on the 05:30 S1A.

Regionally, there is quite a bit of ice dynamics, mostly shearing. The PS and
KD are perhaps 10 km north (down) of a massive block shear zone. The overnight
pair of images below are being viewed in a coordinate system in which the
Polarstern is fixed.

This would have been a full-on disaster had the shear line come through Ice
Camp while the Polarstern was refueling or exchanging out equipment and
scientists. It didn't and people on the ground may have been oblivious to it.

The explanation of the event is the passing of mild wind shear from southeast
to northwest across the Polarstern's position. At no time were winds extreme;
instead the delta of wind (6 km/hr to 31 km/hr) caused the ice to move
differentially across the gradient.

The ice is still too mechanically weak this winter to distort south of the PS's
position so brittle-fractured along a line parallel to wind stress where it is
thicker. The event is largely over per GFS though ice movement is foreseen to
somewhat reverse in coming days. Again, this was not a winter cyclone, just
uneven regional wind stress.

On uniq's upcoming (we hope!) mega buoy animation, we can expect some sharp
zigzags distinguishing buoy sets above and below the event. This will greatly
improve time resolution of the main fracture over what 24-hr S1AB can do, in
this instance 24 less 2:36 hrs compared to half-hourly or even ten minutes.

I'll only do this once, because I have nothing to add but gratitude. A-Team's
last 24-hr shear gif is jaw-dropping. It sure looks to be a dangerous place.
The people on that boat are clearly risking their lives for invaluable
understanding of the icecap. Above and beyond... what can you say?

The reporting in this thread has been riveting, and also invaluable for
understanding the icecap.

Festive season so a little bit late. Here testing animation of many iabp buoys,
one showing a spurious latlon and a couple who think it's14dec already. It may
take more analysis (than I am capable of right now) to detect that shear.
Interesting that one buoy to the south jumped backwards though

see update below.

    24-hr shear gif is jaw-dropping

Early morning, just absent-mindedly updating the S1AB collection, not seeing
any drama on the ingest of the three Dec 13's, not expecting much by way of
drift at low wind, at best thinking about the KD cutting a swath
pre-conditioning the ice camp to future lead and ridge problems, then wondering
when that meaningless lead came about, checking with the 24 hr, making the
overlay pair, running it real fast in ImageJ, then my jaw-dropping moment
seeing the long shear boundary, to pondering what an event-driven diesel spill
during refueling the PS would mean for Arctic research, to asking whether risk
to researchers is maybe higher than anticipated (indeed higher than acceptable,
this being the 4th major incident in 69 days), to looking at historical stats
on expected major cyclones of winter still ahead.

We have the tools to do a lot more analysis on the Friday The 13th fracture
(FT13). It does seem fairly easy to recognize conditions conducive to
disruptive events a couple days out on GFS, though it seems we don't know
enough about ice pack strength to differentiate between deformation and shear,
much less predict location of shear lines relative to the Mosaic ice camp. The
surprise is, we do know enough to make those predictions.

The attachments below are just two plain text documents giving active urls to
all Sentinel Viewer back to mooring and their accompanying PS position- and
S1AB-aware GFS nullschools. The buoy position repositories and ship weather are
at their respective archives

Sure, we could post a swinging risk needle like the Forest Service does for
fire hazard but would it really be actionable down at the ship, would someone
not go out to tend a deployed instrument when the needle was on yellow or red?

The buoy swarm animation provides a very sensitive nrt tool that can detect and
report occurrences of not-too-remote rifting, though their current distribution
was not thought out and is sub-optimal. However an after-the-fact announcement
is not a warning, unless the shearing is taking place in abrupt stages (like
earthquake after-shocks).

Here Uniq will be looking for an upper zone of plastic buoy position
deformation in conjunction with a lower zone of rigidity that preceded the
rupture at the interface. Would that give hours of warning or minutes? Would
that give warnings of all events or just some?

Here we need a whole lot less mickey mouse from the inhabitants of the Mosaic
buoy deploying academic silos, like delays in posting, lack of Iridium redials,
lack of time synchronization, irregular GPS reads, lack of gap repair, lack of
QA, and worst of all, dumbing down the decimal points (AWI, I'm talking to
you).

In other words, changing inter-buoy distances provide an interferometric mesh
from which a tensiometer is built. GPS is not up to lasers but still very
capable today since Every Decimal Point Matters even if the last is not quite
as good as the first. Right now, buoy runs take too long for the desktop but
there are ultra-fast migration options for anything in R.

Given eight years of planning, why are we scrambling today to put together risk
mitigation software?

    one showing a spurious lat lon and a couple who think it's 15 dec already.
    Will make a manual correction at some point.

Somebody not doing a proper job of curation and posting in ingestible format at
the upper end makes pipeline science all but impossible for everyone
downstream. Buoys and AWI wx present new problems every day. (Despite that, the
latter is ingested directly by ECMWF for Arctic forecasting.)

Even if you made manual corrections all the way back to Oct 4th (and posted
them prominently), there is no mechanism to correct the source (ie fix shabby
or non-existent QA tools there). Tomorrow, instead of rolling your animation
forward on auto-pilot to the next day, the add-ons will have to be manually
corrected. For 95 buoys? For 95 pipelines feeding large scale climate
prediction?

Following up on the near-catastrophic shear on Dec 13, the buoy system should
show a lurch to the right (west) on the more southerly buoys above the shear
line relative to the buoys on the Polarstern side of the line (north is below).

However that is not immediately apparent, probably because we need to run the
buoy data much closer to its intrinsic positional resolution. That is, it would
suffice to limit the graticule to 86.50-86.65 and 117-121 or about a tenth of
the area in uniq's animation above. This would allow more of the 4-5 decimal
points in the buoys's GPS to come into play, not just one.

Alternatively, if the rupture was not abrupt but spread out over a few hours,
we might have to dig into select buoy db numerical analysis rather than rely on
graphics to date the event.

In terms of weather contribution to causality, 3-hour GFS shows a complete
reversal of wind direction accompanied by an up down up cycle of wind strength
with sharp wind curvature in between though not right at the Polarstern's
location. Note this wx depiction would not be identical to the GFS forecast on
Dec 12th because it re-initializes each day; the time series was made well
after the fact.

Until the buoy reanalysis is finalized, it is not feasible to assign a time of
shear rupture to a pair of bracketing GFS frames; even then we don't know the
offset between cause and effect.

Quick messy comparison of 4 buoys close to the shear. The drift path difference
would appear to be subtle at this resolution. The datetime and buoyid's are
good. LatLon text is not updating yet.

#420 digitized shear...
p201 is 8912800
p207 is 8918790
PS should be located between these two buoys, one square to the left. Perhaps
my manual labelling is suspect?

< the buoy system should show a lurch to the right>
 lurch may happen before the animation starts, though the timing is wrong. Will
zoom in further I think.

Right, this is all about getting to the right scale as constrained by forum
image widths. Previously we've determined that a degree of latitude as marked
on S1AB jpg with lines is 2712.26 pixels for what we know is 111.111 km on
WGS84 (which we have to use here as all GPS data refers to the earth
ellipsoid).

Thus image distances can be measured in pixels (often fractional if points are
diagonal) and converted to meters by multiplying by 41.0 for both S1AB jpg and
S1AB.8bit.jp2 (at 100% zoom in the polar viewer plugin).

Doing this, it emerges that the Polarstern was 3703 m north of the shear line.
The 79 km long open lead created in this area ranged from 730 m in width to a
more typical 487 m to 159 m at narrows. A lead of this width cannot be bridged
by wooden palettes and a sled, nor is it feasible to kayak across regularly
carrying staff, bear guards and fuel for instruments (as Mosaic was doing
earlier).

The dramatic regional shear animation of post #412 that compared Dec 12 06:19
to Dec 13 03:43, repeated below, was done in Polarstern-stationary coordinates
(lagrangian) which removes background ice pack movement (secular drift).

The rifting took place as the pack as a whole moved almost due westward by 4301
m but with a 410 m north component. Relative to the Polarstern, the shear area
moved an additional 4146 m southeastward.

[index]

It's worth walking through GPS decimal points which have quite different
associated measures for lon than lat.

At 86.6º, a tenth of a latitude degree increment represents 11.111 km, a
hundredth 1111 m, a thousandth 111 m, a ten-thousandth 11.1 m and a
hundred-thousandth 1.1 m.  The first is what we are looking at with sailwx and
AWImet; the second what GFS-nullschool can discriminate at maximal scale, the
third enough to show a buoy lurch and the last the nominal resolution claimed
by typical Mosaic buoys (4th GPS decimal point).

Note the buoys are in motion during whatever time it takes for them to measure
their position. Those speeds, given as the color scale on uniq's animations
rarely exceed 1 km/hr which is 1000 m per 3600 seconds or 0.27 m/s. So if it
took them 5 seconds, that would be 1.4 m which might amount to a correction to
their last decimal.

2019 12 13 0343  86.6  119.5  86.5918  119.4764  rough and refined PS locations
post shear
2019 12 12 0619  86.6  120.1  86.5982  120.1285  rough and refined PS locations
pre shear

So what needs to be done -- and I am leaving this to Tor B -- is download the
data files for 2-3 buoys above the shear and 2-3 below using the map below (or
as provided by uniq), delete the irrelevant columns, combine into a single
spreadsheet with times of reported synchronized by row. Then add a new column
and fill with the subtraction of above/below longitude columns.

The graph should show a big lurch at the hour of rifting.

As a control, go back a week or so to establish the big lurch is way out of the
ordinary, not 'normal variation'. Going forward, the winds have hardly been
enough to stress the ice, meaning delaunay buoy triangulations across the shear
line will have stable edges.

Nonetheless, this morning's pair of S1AB 3 hrs 16 min apart don't show a
quiescent situation on the Mosaic ice pack (lower animation). Indeed a small
rift seems to be closing at the later time. This does not necessarily affected
deployed instruments as only a small flat area near the ship is currently used.

The Kapitan Dranitsyn can be seen crossing the shear line within hours of its
formation. It's not clear what would happen to an icebreaker caught in a sudden
shear event. The Polarstern, being frozen in for a year, is more at risk.

Shear events with km scale displacements are multi-daily events even at the
scale of a single S1AB frame, but one crossing a 118 m object amidship would
not be expected unless the ship, like Los Angeles, is sitting on an inactive
fault line predisposed to re-awakening.

While the Polarstern has not disclosed the data that would allow analysis (it
being below the resolution of S1AB), they have had slabs of ice sliding back
and forth in front of the bow, micro-shear events. In addition, the
undocumented Dec 6th event saw a larger faulting event come right through
Mosaic ice camp.

In summary, the ice has been shifting around a lot already this winter at
various scales with only 2 months down and 4-5 months to go. It's tempting to
say 'more than usual' but hard to go beyond anecdotal impressions. This has
been a very odd winter in terms of no coherent ice pack drift (as visualized
above in Ascat whole-Arctic mp4).

Quite festive here today but also some interest in arctic buoys so here are 7
buoys close to the rift. We've voted that the one on it's own has a data glitch
(8916790).

edit: I change my vote since it looks like 8916790 was right on the rift.

In my naivety I thought the MOSAIC project might be lucky as far as the
solidity of the ice pack was concerned.

For why? The Central Arctic Sea froze up so early this year from a minimum that
was also higher than in recent years.

How wrong can I get?

Here are recent paper titles from the highly qualified Mosaic leg 2 leader,
AWI's Christian Haas. His interests are much more remote sensing and
ice-related than leg 1 atmospheric physicists. Let's hope that there will be a
much more open science focus to Polarstern communications in coming months.

Winter rain, as Haas notes, would really be a game-changer for snow thermal
properties and spring albedo. The recent polar lightning, detected by a Finnish
company specializing in remote detection and employing my neighbor, also came
as quite a surprise. The Polarstern is not set up to detect it unless it is
right overhead. Rain? The PS may have doppler radar but not one dedicated to
rare events.

Some strong winds are expected this week but nothing approaching gale force.
The GFS outlook has changed so much from yesterday that it is hard to predict
coming Polarstern drift, though it will be almost entirely to the west (smaller
longitudes) with a small component north, so maybe 86.7, 114.0 by Dec 20th from
where it is now, 86.6, 117.7.

from B_'s link (above - Change of Shifts at the North Pole):
Quote

    Leg 1 of the MOSAiC expedition in numbers:

    To date, the Polarstern has drifted 200 kilometres toward the North Pole.
    Thanks to its zigzagging course, the total distance travelled is 720
    kilometres.

    The highest drift speed – 1.4 km/h – was reached on 16 November 2019. On
    this single day, the ship drifted more than 20 kilometres.

    Some of the research stations on the ice were moved up to 600 metres by
    processes in the ice.

    There have been 8 days with gale-force wind speeds exceeding 15 metres/
    second (54 km/h). During the most powerful storm, on 16 November 2019, wind
    speeds of up to 100 km/hr were clocked.

    There have been polar bear sightings on 9 days, including sightings of lone
    bears, and of mother bears with one or two cubs each.

    As a result of these sightings, or approaching storms, the ice floe has
    been evacuated at short notice roughly half a dozen times. And there were
    other days on which the presence of bears or storm conditions made it
    impossible to go out on the ice at all. / made the ice off limits.

    To date, MOSAiC participants have spent roughly 500 hours working on the
    ice.

    Temperatures bottomed out at minus 32 degrees Celsius; the ocean
    temperature is currently minus 1.5 degrees Celsius at the surface.

    More than 5 kilometres of roads were created on the ice’s surface.

    The research camp on the ice floe consists of ca. 100 tonnes of equipment.

    Ca. 20 terabytes of data have been gathered.

    The researchers and crew have consumed 12.7 tonnes of food.

    125 buoys, which serve as autonomous monitoring systems and can transmit
    their data directly by satellite, have been deployed.

    Oh what tangled webs we weave, when first we practice to deceive (W Scott,
    1808)

Here the wind power density during leg 1 is shown once a day for days that have
have S1AB images, with a few gaps filled in by interpolation so all 78 days are
represented. The four storm events show up fairly clearly on the slides though
here the GFS needs to have its 3-hour resolution shown that brackets each
event.

These unfortunately run into file size problems at decent resolution, even
compressed as mp4 (which works better at faster displays than for slide shows;
nullschool images have very complex color and compress poorly). I don't really
see a way forward for a year long expedition other than breaking into months or
legs.

    The video shows how the initial grid distorts over time by the uneven ice
    drift over time within the grid array. This results in opening (ice
    divergence) and closing (ice compression and ridging), shear and vorticity.
    This shear caused a massive crack to form through the experiment ice floe,
    disrupting the experiments and forcing movement of some of the
    instrumentation.

    https://phys.org/news/2019-12-dark-radar-satellites.html

Grid distortion is another approach to visualizing ice pack motion around the
Polarstern from R Kwok at JPL that was posted as a poor quality youTube by ESA
(with a gratuitous rocket launch appended). For better quality, see the
original large slow file  (5.2 MB, 720x 720):

http://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Videos/2019/12/Polarstern_under_the_radar

No information provided about how it was made or what it shows quantitatively;
it uses 23 of the 41 available S1AB of Oct 2019. Usually AI is used to match up
features in consecutive image pairs (which can be done in ImageJ) and the
distortion gridded after interpolation. Only rarely can features be followed
for any length of time so the rolling pair uses different ones.

The scale is reduced so the white dot of the Polarstern is hard to see. It is
held fixed but proper alignment requires rotation before translation as the
ship wandered quite a bit over the month, with longitudinal extremes of 124.5
to 135.8.

Quote

    Here we made use of high-resolution radar images from the German TerraSAR-X
    satellite to help locate the best-possible floe. Copernicus Sentinel-1
    satellites help follow and predict the ever-changing drift of the sea ice
    up to 300 km away from the ship.

    The Japanese ALOS-2 satellite with its PalSAR-2 sensor uses a much longer
    wavelength than both Copernicus Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X to map sea-ice
    floes and conditions below.  ALOS-2 can provide on sea-ice conditions
    especially now that we are developing our own long-wavelength radar
    satellite called the L-band Synthetic Aperture mission ROSE-L which is one
    of the six Copernicus high-priority candidate missions. CIMR and CRISTAL
    upcoming sensors will also benefit, a microwave radiometer and ice/snow
    topographic altimeter.


Only one TerraSAR-X image has been released by Mosaic, mistakenly by a student;
fortuitously it contained the floe selected a few days later. However the
quality (as posted) was no improvement on Sentinel-1AB.

PalSAR-2 is much more interesting. I don't know if there is a public archive
nor whether it routinely archives images the Arctic Ocean. The one posted
example is intriguingly false color, suggesting either multiple wavelengths or
HH+HV polarization color channels. It was taken on 19 Nov 19 but does not
include the Polarstern in the scene (nor any location information).

L-band SAR has a longer wavelength relative to surface roughness compared with
C-band SAR and has improved ice-type separability due to deeper ice
penetration. However it does not do as well on melt-onset detection.

https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/a/alos-2

The DFD (German center for remote sensing) is providing TerraSAR-X images to
the Polarstern in near-real time. Ground receiving stations in Inuvik and
Longyearbyen help Neustrelitz rapidly process and relay the imagery to the
ship. RADARSAT-2 imagery is also provided; in theory PolarView portals it but
the imagery may only be relevant to the CAA.

In terms of fancy GPS onboard the Polarstern, the DLR (Deutsches Luft Raumfahrt
) installed a measurement system for receiving and storing raw signals from
navigation satellites. They will be measuring the disturbances of the Galileo
and GPS navigation signals with a high-rate receiver. Solar flare cause
scintillations, fluctuations of the electron density in Earth's ionosphere
which influence propagation of electromagnetic radiation; this degrades the
positional accuracy derived from navigation satellites so counter-measures need
to be developed.

https://www.dlr.de/content/en/articles/news/2019/03/
20190920_dlr-messtechnik-friert-mit-polarstern-im-nordpolarmeer-ein-en.html

The five-day GFS suggests a half day more of rapid westward loss in longitude
(remembering that a degree of lon means very few km at very high lat) with lat
gaining slightly to 86.7. The Polarstern will then spend a couple of days
almost becalmed before heading back south and
east to locations it has been before.

A 70 day comparison is shown below. Although the Mosaic floe has changed rather
dramatically over this time frame, some neighboring patches traveling with it
remain identifiable. The later  image has been rotated to match the longitude
of the first before translating the Polarstern dot to co-register.

Best yet!

Here is an ambitious alternative GIS offering from Meereis Portal that has some
click-thru information on buoy names and properties. It does not seem to be
working at at a sufficient number of lat lon decimal points to capture fine
detail of tracks relative to the Polarstern.

Oddly it does not link to the Meereis buoy data launch itself or to their own
hourly averaged weather data. Overall, it is slow to load and over-reacts to
unintended mousing. Leaflet we've seen before in Mercator Ocean. A lot of these
track-n-stack tools reinvent the wheel (aka Google Earth).

https://epic.awi.de/id/eprint/49939/1/MOSAiC_SENSORChiefEditors_2019-07-16.pdf
big overview

Meereis Portal is currently showing 102 'active' Mosaic buoys. The Polarstern
(DBLK) itself is of course a giant buoy; when its lat lon is inserted, a sort
shows the closest buoys. (However this won't be accurate unless all the times
are in fact synchronized.)

Their master search tool shows 97 buoys, sensor.awi.de. IABP lists only 96
Mosaic buoys of which 81 are still reporting and 15 are dead.

The :) from "communication specialists" at AWi says 124 buoys. Buoys must
register an IMEI under international law, so the options are badly misinformed,
ongoing crime, buoys installed on the main floe reporting directly over the
LAN, and newly launched buoys brought by the KD not yet linking to IABP.

Winds are mild for now so only minor movements are seen in the ice pack near
the Polarstern on 18 Dec 19. Since mooring, winds have averaged 7.5 m/s from
136º. The maximal sustained wind speed according to the ship's own anemometer
was 21m/s on Nov 16th, again contrary to  :).

Here the issue is not what gusts of wind occurred on top of the 32m Met tower
(or mast on the ship bridge  :) ) but how (unevenly) sustained wind power
density coupled to the ice as stress (peak GFS, bottom image).

Temperatures have averaged -19.2º with a coldest sustained low of -30.9ºC, not 
:). You would see conditions like this every winter in Chicago or Minneapolis
but with 10x the snowfall.

Two blogs released today by co-leader M Shupe: these don't quite get up to
cover the Dec 6th mega-event. With the complexity of the leg1/leg2 exchange and
return to shore on the KD, that may fall through the cracks as the  :) AWI PR
team :) for sure will never mention it (see #429 and #431 above).

https://blogs.agu.org/thefield/2019/12/17/
postcards-from-a-frozen-icebreaker-part-15/

24 Nov 19: "Today was especially challenging because there was fresh snow that
had blown across everything, covering cracks and thin ice. Blowing snow in the
air limited visibility, and gave a bite to the cheeks. On our way out there
were new cracks right under the road, most passable on a snow machine if you
keep moving.

Eventually the snow machine was no longer possible so we continued on foot,
coming eventually to crossing that had been active before. It was hard to tell
its conditions today, with all of the new snow. Some probing showed areas of
strength and areas that were soft.

I probed on two sides of an area, finding strength, then took a step…. But my
foot keep sinking down into the slushy ice-snow mixture. I quickly flattened
out, my upper body and one foot on solid ice but my knee pushing down into the
slush. Two travel partners were there to help, and I made it back safely onto
fully solid ice.

I ended up with a wet knee and fore-leg, but no water inside my suit or boot. A
bit of a thrill but safe in the end, and we made it through to do our work. On
that same trip we had another wet boot, and there have been many similar
occurrences, the most extreme being someone in up to their waist but quickly
extracted.

30 Nov 16: Cleaned up after heavy polar bear damage to remote L2 site: a lot of
problems with fingers and face masks in the cold and wind but got it
transmitting again

03 Dec 19: Once again the ice dynamics have become active. High winds from the
south have been pushing against our floe, and across the major shear zone that
extended across the front of the ship.

We’ve seen a little bit of activity there in the last days, but not much. But
now things have really come together, jagged pieces of ice getting pushed 3-4
meters up into the air, likely extending 20m below the surface.

Beautiful blue ice, with the winds whipping snow up and over the top in a
swirling dance. This ridge was eating our power line, as well as two Nansen
sleds that were parked by a little crack. These sleds were being used as a
bridge to cross a 1.5m crack before. Now they were captive by the ridge,
although mostly pushed up on top.

A small team of us went out to recover the sleds, successfully. The ridge
groaned occasionally, but was most done with its movements for now. A new
jumble of blocks, some the size of Volkswagens. And our power cable extending
up and over the top.

We freed some of the tension on the ship side by helping to reroute the cable
line. Then climbed up over the top of the ridge to the other side, to find that
the cable had been dragged underneath a couple of huge blocks of ice. No way to
move or break these.

The cable is still functional; Met City still has power. But we are out of
cable connectors. So we can’t simply cut this line and then patch it back
together with some new connectors. Our decision is to just leave it here for
now, wrapped around these ice blocks and extending down into the water at one
place."

Comment:  Should 3-4 high loose blocks of jumbled ice be treated as 3-4 m of
ice thickness? What about keels 20 m deep created by one floe over-riding
another?

No. These should not be conflated in thickness compilations with the millions
of sq km of multi-year ice that is has built up from accretion of freezing
seawater onto the under surface. Blocks of jumbled ice contribute nothing to
extensional or compressional strength and melt very differently from MYI.

Pressure ridges do play a special role in sequestering wind-blown snow,
decreasing its thickness and insulation of regular ice, making it more
susceptible to spring melt pond formation (which these pressure ridges may
contain and prevent drainage. Elevated rough-surfaced ridges could play a
dominant role in catching the wind, thus in ice motion and further floe
collisions in a runaway situtation of ridges leading to more ridges.

Keels have been studied extensively in the past by upward looking submarine
sonar and today to a much more limited areal extent by underwater ROV. Keels
initially impede ice dynamics as wind stress experiences drag. Over time, keels
round out and erode, lessening drag and sea water advection.

Google Earth Pro freeware and simple kml instructions provide an alternative to
the Meereis GIS Portal and uniq's buoy tracking animations.

While GEP has a learning curve and the kml markup language an off-putting
schema, it is easy to make a simple template to display a point, line or
triangle, then stub in the lon lat numbers and related links from buoy or
Polarstern tables.

https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference

The attached table for the Polarstern provides high resolution location data as
well as the link to PolarViewer S1AB image and GFS nullschool weather. GEP
allows each of these, as well as links to forum images (such as buoy
animations) to be attached to each point of its display (second screenshot).

The kml format is just structured plain text that is human readable with a
little practice. More importantly, anyone can download the data once the GE
viewer is loaded. There is no sharing possible on the AWI setup. With an
attached table, uniq could distribute the data underlying the buoy animations

While the view necessarily gets complicated if the PS and all 96 buoy tracks
are loaded, it is easy to group these into sets and turn combinations on and
off. The zoom has a phenomenal range so only the last few days can be
displayed. Note the view is from space: plate carrée differs from plane polar
coordinates though not so much at high zoom.

GEP will also calculate distances, perimeters and areas very accurately though
this has to be done one at a time by request and manually captured. It is also
feasible to port GEP to external web browsers that retain some of the main
interactive features. That could then be linked in as a forum remote url.

Meanwhile, back on the ice, the Polarstern is basically becalmed but towards
the middle of the GFS outlook will start drifting the wrong way again, south
and east. Nonetheless, the S1AB imagery shows change on the Mosaic floe again
today. Maybe with the staff turnover, someone there will finally provide active
updates -- after all, improving satellite interpretation is one of the primary
Mosaic objectives.

Indeed the track of the Kapitan Dranitsyn can be see above leaving from the SE
(middle left) the way it came in. We don't have enough resolution to see
maneuvering in the immediate vicinity of the Mosaic floe.

The dotted box shows an ambiguous area where the KD may have had temporary
difficulty finding an easy route. Otherwise, a straight track means the captain
did not rate obstacles worth avoiding (ie no issues presented buy thick ice or
pressure ridges).

All three ships maintain an ice thickness watch during the entire time of
transiting. Trained observers compare ice being overturned to markings on a
meter stick sticking out from the hull.

While the data is recorded (on an iPad?), it is not shared with expedition
funders (taxpayers) even though improving navigation safety and satellite
products such as cryo2Smos are stated mission objectives. The KD, like the PS
and AK, has excellent internet service, the iPad twitter, text and email and
AWI hundreds of terabytes of storage.

Some 15 thermistor buoys have been deployed so far during the Mosaic
expedition. The data for them is well-organized at Meereis Portal except for
time synchronization. The time and GPS lat lon can be downloaded as simple
3-column tables and consolidated into a 45 column table from which any mix and
match of kml-readable polygons can be made using a concatenate tool and
fill-down.  These can be displayed one at a time in GoogEarth and captured for
a delaunay-style animation along with their haversine separations. Details left
to Tor B.

M Nicolaus has a strong background in sea ice physics with a special interest
in autonomous buoy arrays and underwater ROVs and took part in N-ICE 2015. Some
of his 2018-19 publications are attached below. Like C Haas, he supports open
research and better communications with the public. (We shall see.)

The ROV site had to be taken out of action yet again due to new shearing, floe
leads and pressure ridges that they are blaming the KD track for. We don't have
a close-in map of KD movements because S1AB is spotty and barely has enough
resolution to catch ephemeral tracks.

No maps of the revised Mosaic ice camp or summary of instrument status during
leg 1 have been provided for months; only the vaguest text indications have
been provided so far (eg, MET shifted 0.6 km past the bow).

The Dec 19th photo at 'follow mosaic' shows the KD leaving. The condition of
the ice is shocking -- the full-size picture is worth a close look.

One horrific mistake I see over and over at Meereis  and Mosaic sites is 
confusion between data and information. It is completely irrelevant that they
collected 26 terabytes of data (enough to fill a $175 external drive for an
iMac). The web cam at my birdfeeder provides much more than that yet very
little information (sparrows like sunflower seeds). What information is in
those 26 TB ... soot from the PS smokestacks makes aerosol monitoring
unworkable? And how is the short shelf life of Arctic information accounted for
if publications are put off to 2023 as planned?

    for an iMac). The web cam at my birdfeeder provides much more than that yet
    very little information (sparrows like sunflower seeds). What information
    is in those 26 TB ... soot from the PS smokestacks makes aerosol monitoring
    unworkable? And how is the short shelf life of Arctic information accounted
    for if publications are put off to 2023 as planned?

This GIF is showing the departure of the Kapitan Dranitsyn.

Quote from: A-Team on December 19, 2019, 05:25:40 PM

    The dotted box shows an ambiguous area where the KD may have had temporary
    difficulty finding an easy route. Otherwise, a straight track means the
    captain did not rate obstacles worth avoiding (ie no issues presented buy
    thick ice or pressure ridges).


Looks like the KD was stuck after that for a few hours?

I'm supposed to study PHP. So i did what people do in this situation:
Procrastinating by playing around with the RAMMB-SLIDER.

I found what i think to be the best setting to track the Polarstern if you
don't like or know how to interpret the infrared bands.

This is M13 (4.05 µm "Fire Detection") & Geo-Color. It is obvious what the
clouds are while also seeing the cracks and of course the bright dot that is
the Polarstern.

The position of the PS via Day&Night band, 60 frames, 51-minute increments.

I chose this band because it's the most complete set of frames.

We are moving very slowly in the wrong direction ATM (North is right).  :-\

Two significant new offerings at Meereis Portal: the interactive buoy GIS
display discussed earlier in #437 and release of sea ice motion radar cam
scenes looking out from the Polarstern bridge  (link in #454).

Note the comparable radar on the antique RV Lance digitized an image a minute
with a 360º view and range of 9 km during N-ICE2015 whereas with Mosaic the
280º field of view excludes the Ice Cam, reports every six hours (ie at 1/360
the frame rate) with only 5.2 km of range.

Note the 06:00 daily nadir S1AB coincides with the 06:00 oblique ship radar,
meaning the two cannot be color-composited though the Sentinel at 200% can fill
in the missing ice camp (2nd image).

We looked at marginal ice zone action and a radar cam article back in #83:
https://doi.org/10.1002/2016JC012387

Presumably the PS has more sophisticated radar than they're letting out because
you can buy better recreational boating radar for a few $k on ebay. The
blackout on the Ice Camp could plausibly be attributed to rfi with all the
other equipment out there. Dedicated instruments and strain panels monitor
conditions there but that data has not been shared except anecdotally (and via
S1AB analysis here). 

The full dataset is sent daily over the Polarstern's fast internet (still being
denied on Dec 27th) to Bremerhaven where it is bundled into rolling windows of
two weeks extent (14 days x 4x = 56 frames served as slow avi movies). The
archive goes back to Nov 1st but increments daily. No explanation has been
offered for the delayed upload on Dec 15th and first mention on "Follow Mosaic"
on Dec 28th.

It's not clear if the Oct 4-31 floe motion is being held back or just delayed.
The ice would have been in total chaos back then going by the chaos of the last
two months in strengthened thickened ice, below. The minute-by-minute research
grade terabyte dataset is not available which is appropriate.

The archive began duplicating the avi with identical and fully interchangeable
m4v formatted videos on Dec 15th, reminiscent of the head-scratching
duplication of 'mosaic_multisensor' with all-purple sea ice concentration
overlays.

The file sizes are kept to a few MB using avi even though they are really just
gif slide shows. ImageJ is very unusual in having an avi reader. This opens
them as image stacks, with helpful options for grayscale and 180º rotation (to
better align with S1AB and other 'greenland down' satellite imagery).

ImageJ is also very good at sharpening the periphery, reducing the overly
bright returns from ice near the bow, changing palette, and concatenating
bimonthly bites into a single image. Surprisingly converting the avi to
forum-friendly mp4 at https://cloudconvert.com give as very helpful further
reduction in file size.

The smaller gif at the bottom features the dramatic lead that opened a few km
south of the Polarstern on 15 Dec 2019. Moderate benefit can come from contrast
enhancement, sharpening and an indexed palette.

The bridge radar is confusing on first view, so set it on loop and (after
download) click repeatedly on the double arrow to speed it up. The white scale
bar is intrusive. Its central tip is the center of the fixed polar coordinate
frame in which the bridge radar is stationary. It isn't clear if the bow-stern
axis is also fixed nor if it points north-south. (The integrated navigation
system records this information but it is not provided.)

The timestamp would be better with seconds and minutes rounded away,
repositioned lower into vacant black space. The stern may wag about causing the
view to shift when little is actually happening; the ship is also drifts and
rotates quite a bit over the 60-day time frame of the video.

Overall, it is astonishing that scientists have been able to keep equipment
deployed on the ice running at all. Actually, we have no idea how Leg 1 data
collection went as little can be gleaned from short :) reports.

Expeditions like this were already being squeezed out of the picture by
advanced calibrated satellites, massive buoy arrays and long range autonomous
gliders. The ice seems too far gone for the floe platform concept to work.

Just because the ship will be drifting aimlessly until early January (when
winds sweeping up from Siberia will finally send it Fram-ward) doesn't mean the
ice will be quiescent. Worse, record lows have arrived with -34.7ºC recorded on
19-12-28 at 23:00 utc, making damaged equipment that much harder to repair.

And it seems that we are far short of the 8-10 extreme weather events expected
in winter at the Polarstern's location (below or see #368). It's been quite
stormy in the North Atlantic but so far extreme weather has not moved up past
Svalbard to any extent.

    NSIDC's MOSAIC website

That has nothing to do with NSIDC. It is educational material for teachers of
kindergarten-6th grade put together by CIRES from 'follow mosaic' blurbs. Note
it makes no sense to give lat lon out to two positions but not the timestamp
when longitude can jump by 4º in a single day.
Quote

    Since October, not drifted very far. Drift quite small over the last 2
    weeks.

Correct. The Polarstern is way behind their anticipated location for this date.
This matters, as drift across the Eurasian Basin was one of the three core
pillars of the expedition. So far, even including the 45-km wide swath, very
little of the Arctic Ocean has been sampled.

The second pillar, evolution of a fixed floe and its surrounding ice over a
full annual cycle, has effectively been abandoned as the floe is already in
shambles. You can see that from S1AB daily turmoil on the Mosaic floe, from the
nrt ship forward-looking radar, and from plaintive postings about downed
deployed equipment.

The third, continuous ice, water and atmospheric observational data not
obtainable from satellite, buoys or autonomous gliders is in wait-and-see mode
as it's not clear what fraction of the time deployed instrumentation has been
operational. Since each year of ice weather is one-off, especially these days,
the biggest benefit may come from calibration of satellites and better
understanding of what autonomous tools are reporting.

The Polarstern will finally be getting a couple days of favorable tailwind
(below) but winds are not strong enough to move the multi million sq km block
of MYI (Modis/Ascat up-forum) sitting between them and the pole.

I foresee them reaching 87.1ºN (still 335 km short) and perhaps 112ºE which is
actually more Fram-favorable as circumpolar drift has been far more frequent
than transpolar over the last decade.

On nullschool, checking the 'grid' overlay helps visualize the angle of wind
relative to circles of constant latitude. The ice generally moves 'to the
right' of streamlines, per Nansen. So it is only in the latter frames that the
wind is providing a poleward stress component.

Here the position of the ship needs to be adjusted frame by frame to account
for how much drift has taken place as the forecast progresses. Otherwise the
wind bearing and speed won't be appropriate to the actual position. Those can
be estimated quite well by finding an applicable period of the wind speed and
bearing on the 1940-line ship hourly wx report. An iteration might improve the
drift forecast,

https://www.awi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/MET/PolarsternCoursePlot/
psobsedat.html

The second attachment below provides 168 high precision locations of the PS
from mooring until today along with built urls to S1AB and GFS and rotation
angles to put north up for the given location (so as to match orientation of
the dramatic new observation deck radar).

That archive is being actively kept up though the 1024x1024 size of the rolling
avi video needs adjustments to display here. Dec 29th is missing entirely.
Hopefully the missing month of October will eventually be supplied. It would be
of interest to annotate the jigsaw puzzle action to see if fissures repeat over
time and how big events correlate with GFS wind stress.

https://data.meereisportal.de/maps/animations/Iceradar/

Technical note: This unusual radar imagery is sub-optimal as archived, mostly
because it is too bright near the bow, too dim overall and too fuzzy on the
periphery. These problems are intrinsic to how the radar works.

However because ImageJ has an avi frame reader, complex video editing software
is not needed and some yet-to-be determined combination of our usual tools
(frame deletion, cropping, resizing, moving of timestamp, adaptive contrast,
unsharp mask, gamma-corrected contrast, indexed palettes etc) can improve the
product.

Below, another version of the Polarstern's drift so far based on once-a-day
precise S1AB positions from the csv attached above. We are seeing a great many
wheel reinventions but few improvements on what Google Earth freeware has long
provided in web browser form from a quick template paste and click. The kml
file has to be attached as txt for the forum.

The ascat mp4 shows the Polarstern's position within plastically deforming ice.
Actually the ice is quite strong and brittle at sustained -30ºC temperatures
but appears almost liquid on ascat because over-rafting, ridging and lead
opening take up any slack.

The Polarstern's drift has been contained so far within the small rectangular
overlay; the last frame shows daily drift positions. While the resolution is
much less than S1AB or bow radar, ice motion still appears quite dramatic at
the ship's location even at ascat's scale.

Cryo2Smos ice thickness has progressed up to what Mosaic thought it would be
back on Oct 1st, three full months ago. The regional buoy array could provide
more accurate pointwise data on growth; thickness depends on where and how the
buoy was initially installed. Snow depth, if any, slows transmission of cold
from the air into the ice.

Boundary conditions, in this instance Greenland, can very much constrain ice
response to wind stress.  Right now, with 15 straight hours of 8-10 m/s wind
from a ship wx station bearing of 120º, the Polarstern should be (and is)
moving poleward and to the west.

However there is a lot of thick ice ahead of it and that ice is pressing up
against solid land. This means less actual displacement than if the wind were
still at 240º. The wind field is not homogenous however and has been moving ice
rapidly along north Greenland towards the Fram Strait (above) which may ease
the push-back..

Folding in forecast uncertainty, it isn't feasible to predict ice motion more
than 3-4 days out. Broad-brush seasonal weather forecasting may be on the
horizon but halfway reliable predictions of trans- or circumpolar drift are
lacking, even as hindcasts. Buoy trajectories are largely inapplicable to
Mosaic drift because only 0-1 are launched per year in the central Arctic Ocean
and those mainly in early August.

Sea ice motion will be a major driver of the 'end game' for Arctic sea ice; our
lack of understanding effectively derails all attempts at predicting this from
trend lines.

update on the simb ice mass balance buoys. Two of them were deployed onto
thinner ice and appear to be having some trouble. Perhaps simb4 has tilted or
fallen.
https://www.cryosphereinnovation.com/386850

Also of interest are two meereis Rbuoy charts from buoys with thermistor
chains. These show surface temperature, the temperature gradient through the
ice and water temperature below the ice. There are 208 sensors spaced at 2cm
intervals. It's not easy to tell ice thickness from the charts but by counting
the number of thermistors from [DEL:today's:DEL] yesterday's surface
temperature at ~-32.2C to water at -1.8C they indicate ice+snow thickness of
1.1m to 1.2m

That poster concept above is from M Hoppmann, 05 Apr 2017. It is outdated in
the sense the thermistors today do not need the ship LAN and can report cheaply
to other satellites than Iridium. I do wonder about "powering by regular lead
batteries" which inevitably get dumped as the floe melts.

Chinese researchers have developed better, cheaper thermistor electronics and
have deployed over 50 in the Arctic Ocean over multiple years.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6308795/

Almost looks like they are pushing a small wooden dinghy along rather than a
nansen sled. Hopefully the 'remote sensing equipment' being relocated away from
a new pressure ridge or open lead (?)does not need the jumble of cables and
twisted wires (bottom center) to function.

Temperatures plus wind chill have made it unsafe to take gloves and face masks
off to repair deployed equipment, though conditions are not more extreme than
those seen (somewhere!) in the continental US this time of year

The Nov-Dec close-up of sea ice motion around the Polarstern is a stretch for
Ascat resolution but conveys the instability of the ice pack on a daily level.

Just testing below whether the Meereis Portal m4v format loads to forum
display. No. Even though Neven has it enabled. It is just an iTunes DRM version
of mp4. They are duplicating their avi files with it. Changing extension to mp4
is supposed to work but does not. Lots of threats posted at meereisportal under
German copyright law, not allowed in the US in view of NSF (taxpayer) funding.
Avi is best for us because ImageJ has a frame reader only for it.

Radar animations appear to have stopped at dec31. Hopefully they will resume.

drift update jan2[DEL:-3:DEL], some data is missing over the new year. Some
white space filled with latest polarview,
S1B_EW_GRDM_1SDH_20200103T063526_141B_N_1.final-mos. KapD exit trail still
visible.

Some may have use for animation data attached

There's been a good series of Leg 1 blogs up at UA Fairbanks by R Rembler that
supplement those of M Shupe and BBC. These represent all that we really know --
or will ever know -- about how sea ice motion is affecting operations on the
Mosaic floe.

AWI has censored and silenced all other sources in favor of relentless,
uninformative :). The Carl Zeiss culture of quality is long gone; Germany today
is VW diesel, AWI information management, and 21 of 103 buoys dead within days
including 8 set out by AWI and 2 of 6 placed en route by the Kapitan Dranitsyn.
An additional 24 floe buoys have been silenced and do not report to the
international buoy tracking service.

These buoys aren't AWI's property as they seem to think; the buoys, the ship,
all the equipment and the data itself are owned by taxpayers who funded Mosaic.
AWI itself does not have one pfennig of its own.

As an aside, note the KD's exit swath is still quite visible today on S1AB.
Scientists from Leg 1 just disembarked in Tromsø on Jan 1st; no information is
available on what they observed in transit (ice thickness is always measured).

Big plans for daily bow radar release have seemingly foundered: still no
coverage of Oct 4th to Oct 31, all coverage stopping on Dec 31, no response at
all to polite inquiries from the designated on-shore scientific contacts, web
page promises have been shelved, and annoyance expressed by the Meereis Portal
communication leader that the (non-forum) public dares question map quality and
delays.

Apparently quite a few outside scientists are unhappy with the
kindergarten-level portal; they may not be aware Germany invented kindergarten
back in 1837.

In other words, download a complete bow radar set now before it disappears
forever (or gets locked down in a threatened proprietary format). It takes five
to make a complete non-overlapping set: 20191101_20191114.avi,
20191115_20191128.avi, 20191201_20191214).avi, 20191215_20191228).avi and the
largely redundant 20191218_20191231).avi. These are small files found at https:
//data.meereisportal.de/maps/animations/Iceradar/

Open each as grayscale with the free Imagej frame reader. Do not check 'virtual
stack'. Under Images --> Stack --> Tools --> Concatenate, join the avi in
temporal order, save as avi or gif. In ImageJ, Command-Shift-D pauses to let
you to duplicate any subset of frames, for example ones flanking a certain date
or all those showing major ice action.

    18 Nov 2019 - A big storm By Rob Rember
    https://uaf-iarc.org/author/rob-rember/

    … On Friday 15 Nov 19, we were notified that the weather was going to get
    substantially worse over the weekend and that by Sunday winds would exceed
    gale force (14 m/s). On Saturday the 16th, we quickly went out to sample
    the first- and second-year ice sites in case our Monday coring was
    cancelled.

    The storm came on Saturday night and continued all day Sunday the 17th as
    predicted. Winds consistently exceeded gale force for most of the day. The
    ice opened and closed in front and to the side of the ship several times.
    At one point from the bridge there was 50 m of open water with waves
    beginning to form, while on the [starboard] side the ship continued to be
    moored to the ice floe.

    There were large cracks that opened all over our local area (ocean city,
    remote sensing, ROV site etc.) that stayed open for many hours. We had
    substantial damage to several power lines as the flow separated and came
    back together.

    This morning the wind is still up around 15 m/s and the damage assessment
    has begun. We surveyed our coring sites, they are completely intact and can
    be reached with minimal detours. UAF science has luckily fared well. Other
    sites will require some major rebuilding with 700 kg power nodes tipped
    over as ice drifted/sheared and pulled on cables that were fixed to the
    power distribution hubs.

    In the next 30 minutes we will have a meeting to discuss the new steps. The
    ice is still moving and we are not in a stable situation to begin
    rebuilding. Even so, the UAF team will head out this afternoon to continue
    the sea ice coring times series we started approximately a month ago.


I looked at GFS winds, sailwx, ship weather, Rammb, bow radar and seven
enveloping S1AB images for confirmation, first noting a 2º longitude lurch in
Polarstern position overnight. The big ice radar action came later, on the
19th-20th under continuing strong and strongly shifted winds.

The explanation: ship weather is measured on high and provided as hourly
averages so ground level gale force gusts are depracated; GFS 'surface' winds
are non-observational so the 1000hPa may be better. Both are in good agreement
with Rembler's blog.

Bow radar captures 360º but 80º has been blacked out, notably the entire Mosaic
floe and near-ship instrument area observed by Rember whose times, dates and
wind speeds may be off because the Polarstern does not use UTC and he does not
use the metric system.

I've observed a puzzling non-grasp of causality at Mosaic. Arctic winds and ice
motion stress are basin-wide, not local; nothing can be predicted from ship wx
point forecasts alone. One glance at the GFS forecast -- a strong, sharply
curved cyclone passing repeatedly over the Polarstern at different bearings
should have warned them (indeed we called it out here well in advance). It is
not homogenous high winds that cause destructive ice motion but high curvature
and rapid temporal change in streamlines and their bearings.

    if we all clap our hands, Tinker Bell can fly again (?)

Nothing to cheer about here, the Polarstern is drifting into a a long-stagnant
zone (per Ascat), getting ever farther behind the eight-ball in terms of
hitting their target next October.

Random drift north is not to be conflated with systemic transpolar drift -- the
weather pattern for the latter is specific, very different, and yet to kick in.

RAMMB is cool but what is it good for? Not aurora borealis (via reflection on
clouds); nullschool has a great tool for that already under its ‘Space’
setting.

Real time Polarstern position? The ship already posts its lat lon online once
an hour in real time, that's 2000 times since mooring. It's easy to
heuristically predict the ship's position 3-4 days ahead using GFS-ns winds as
on Dec 31st in #460.

https://www.awi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/MET/PolarsternCoursePlot/
psobsedat.html

Some of the buoys post much more frequently than the 51 minute JPSS satellite
and some have 5 dp of positional data. However the public has been denied
access to the really high accuracy/high frequency ship and floe buoy data.

We also have four dp precision lat lon posted 2-3x a day at 41 m S1AB
resolution attached here back to Oct 4th, 175 scenes to date. RAMMB can’t be
used to patch gaps in S1AB coverage (eg Nov 16th) because its archive only goes
back two weeks.

2020 01 04 0538  8  86.9848 115.4547
2020 01 04 0400  8  86.9780 115.4551

Determining the maximal resolution setting of RAMMB requires a scale screenshot
that includes both the 85º and 87.5º parallels. Those are separated by 698
pixels along the 115º meridian which has length 278.0 km between those two
latitudes. Thus the maximal resolution of RAMMB is 398 m/pxl.

However clouds and atmospheric turbulence lead to a 5x5 pixel blur/wobble in
the Polarstern's dot. Picking the central pixel gives a 3x3 uncertainty so the
actual ability to determine ship latitude is 1200 m, so about 30x worse than
the resolution of S1AB which in turn is 2x worse than bow radar.

On 20-01-04 08:00, the PS was at 87.0,115.4 which means 37 pixels between 115
and 117.5, the next graticule line over on RAMMB maximal resolution. That
distance is 14.55 km. This means that that the longitudinal resolution is about
0.1º, perhaps a slight improvement on the censored location at AWIwx.

    Ship radar images of the last 14 days. Actual radar-image sequence of RV
    Polarstern from the last 14 days. More videos can be found here. From
    January, these videos will be available here by a drop down menu.

    Live stream from on board: The latest radar images of the ship’s
    surroundings. Every day, here at meereisportal.de we show from now on a
    video sequence of ship radar images. The RV Polarstern’s marine radar
    systems will continue to operate throughout the drift phase and images
    produced by the system are transmitted to Bremerhaven several times a day.

    The imaging system, which shows Polarstern in the centre of the screen,
    offers vital information on floe movements, deformation and formation of
    cracks in the ship’s immediate vicinity.

Well, that is a decent plan but higher-ups may have killed that initiative
already. It's only a matter of time (days?) before the above text and two month
archive are deleted from the Meereis Portal server.

My guess: some antique boomer at AWI is obsessed with putting all Mosaic
reports into a thick special-issue journal in 2023. However there are hardly
any print journals left now and there won't be any by then.

Like open source buoy data, bow radar can be processed as it comes in,
published in a timely way, and contribute to our understanding of icepack
deterioration in the Arctic Ocean. In 2023, no one will have the slightest
interest in 2019-20 sea ice motion.

Alternatively, all is well and the delay in posting is due to the lead
scientist on bow radar only returning to port Wednesday on the KD and just back
at work on Monday. I looked at their bow 2017 bowradar paper from the N-ICE2015
five month drift in the very different marginal ice zone (https://doi.org/
10.1002/2016JC012387), earlier work cited there, and the 19 forward citations.

They could readily clone this paper for leg 1-2 and then again for legs 3-4 and
5-6. However it's not clear whether ice motion metrics really describe what is
going on (see below), nor whether seasonal or year-to-year comparisons can be
made, mostly because no previous data exists for the Polarstern's location.

SHEBA, an earlier year frozen into the ice, took place 22 years ago; did the
Des Groseilliers even have bow radar then, was it strictly analog, was it
filmed, is it archived somewhere online? SHEBA and N-ICE2015 both experienced
severe ice motion but more? less? about the same? as the Polarstern is seeing
now.

We have a great opportunity to add value to Polarstern bow radar because  it is
optimized for the bridge when the ship is underway, not for later perusal.
Right now it is over-exposed close to the ship where the return signal is
strongest (radial contrast mask?), blurry on the periphery (radial unsharp
mask?), higher resolution close in (better detail in 2-3x scale enlargement),
offered in grayscale (more interpretable in indexed palette?) and so on.

Still, making a 2x-invert pair below for the tight cyclone of 16 Nov 2019. I
don't see a path forward to really describing the complexity of sea ice motion,
especially the repeated openings and closings of the same floe line, causing
multiple collisions in the same pressure ridge. The extent of ridge venation is
just astonishing at the resolution and incident angle of bow radar.

Polarstern helicopters could be imaging the bow radar surface elevations every
week with lidar. This is imperative for determining ridge elevation and change.
The ROV could be measuring keels from below (though it has scarcely been
operable). Lidar data is apparently taken but not disclosed, other than leaked,
unscaled, undated, ungraticuled images such as in Rembler's October 23 blog.
The blue may just be over-tint on grayscale DEM but with the noxious overlays
and scale again not provided(!), it isn't too useful.

The Jan 2020 lidar (airborne lidar scanner ALS) came back with some new cracks
and ice dynamics in the heavily instrumented L-site. We have no idea where the
site is or where new/old cracks map; no lidar has been released. The L-site is
off-limits to bow radar. Its past and current locations have not been released.

Were buoys deployed within the bow radar viewing fame, can we overlay tracks on
the Nov-Dec footage, what became of buoys during the storm chaos, is the
turmoil seen representative of a larger area?

    Thus the maximal resolution of RAMMB is 398 m/pxl.


They claim:

    Select the map and domain to fit the native resolution of the data. The
    images were plotted using IDL's Lambert Azimuthal projection, which I think
    has the least amount of distortion and does the best job at maintaining the
    native resolution of the instrument. The size of the domain was chosen so
    that each pixel in the resulting image represents the ~375 m resolution of
    the high resolution imagery bands, while trying to keep the resultant file
    size down. (These results are animated GIFs over 20 MB in size as it is.)


Note the ~.

This is the Mosaic forum. If you can find an application for RAMMB, great.
Otherwise perhaps start a separate forum for it?

The aurora borealis is off-topic and done vastly better on nullschool; on the
Polarstern, people report spending two months at sea without seeing even a
single star because the ship has to be so bright. Your image lacks
corroborative evidence yet that should have been easily available because the
AB view (from OVATION / SWPC / NCEP / NWS / NOAA) updates every 10 minutes or
5x the frequency of RAMMB.

Lightning flashes? Rare in the central Arctic but done infinitely better by a
Finnish company detecting weak radio waves. They recently compiled a
surprisingly number of AO events out of their vast global archive. RAMMB, can't
go back in time. That's a big problem for PolarView too.

Snow vs rain? Yes, with interpretation but that is somewhat a false dichotomy.
The Polarstern has lots of snow buoys set out and much fancier ice camp
equipment measuring density, internal melt, flooding history, salinity,
impurities and so forth. Not going to get at those with RAMMB.

Better time resolution of lead opening and closing than S1AB? Possibly, though
RAMMB resolution is not a good match to intrinsic dimensions of ice features.
Six-hour bow radar shows how much S1AB itself misses, despite its 30x better
resolution than RAMMB.

Even recreational bow radar is digitized once a minute so meereis could be
providing 3600x the time resolution or 51x better than RAMMB resolution. Once
an hour is probably the sweet spot in terms of file size and correlating with
hourly wx data and 3-hourly GFS. However for abruptness of kinematics, a bit of
once a minute or continuous analog would be interesting.

Storms? That seems to have been the motivation underpinning RAMMB. For the
Polarstern, what we most need are surface wind forecasts and surface roughness.
The top priority would be getting ECMWF again; windy dropped the Arctic because
there weren't enough clicks.

Transit of relief icebreakers? Yes if only we knew why their progress varied:
were they encountering thick ice, stopping for polar bear photos, or putting
out buoys? So far none of the ships have made their logbooks or ice thickness
data available. Here 51 minutes is better than S1AB burst mode but still not
great for velocity estimation. Then there are is the issue of no one digitizing
location off RAMMB frames and estimating error with that.

As explained here many times, Lambert azimuthal is used is for its equal area
pixels, not because it represents the AO with "less distortion" than conformal
polar stereographic (angle preserving). PS, Greenland down, is standard in
almost all direct satellite products we use. With netCDF we can interconvert in
Panoply.

Lambert thus seems a bad idea because each round of interconversion degrades
already blurry data, ie initial PS to RAMMB to PS for overlay say with
WorldView night bands or S1AB leads loses detail we cannot afford to lose, the
roundtrip is appalling.

The bow radar products above exceeded 150 MB as gifs; 20 MB gifs are a
nothing-burger. Maybe RAMMB could offer mp4 and ditch the horrific download
code too. A 10 terabyte external drive is very affordable (skip starbucks, make
your own coffee and avocado toast).

You might also consider basic contrast adjustments before posting -- two or
three clicks can vastly improve clarity of RAMMB animations. For leads and
ridges, wavelength matters. If day'n'night is looking at escaping heat in
infrared and active radar is looking at roughness backscatter, the two won't
correlate that well.

The RAMMB project deserves our applause for putting a lot of opaque satellite
channels within practical nrt reach. I am open to it having an application to
Mosaic but just don't see what that is. It's hard to find an angle where it is
'best in category'.

Are you serious? A GIF showing the Polarstern is off-topic in the MOSAIC
thread? Is it that what you are saying?

Hey guys, thanks for all the hard-working and posting reports here, and the
tips to other reports..
It seems data will be unevenly distributed amongst researchers and not all of
it may be public.
There should be enough data to many scientists about the globe to produce
results, some results would overlap which should be great as to confirm or put
in check one's another methodology and rationale. Even though Polarstern data
may be broken into pieces and communal science may be harder than necessary, we
shall have an interesting time trying to understand what is going on in the
Arctic and more about the recent history of planet Earth.

The meereis Rbuoys mentioned in post 463 are called radiation buoys. Here are
the latest temperature charts from the 11 working thermistor Tbuoys.
Snow ice thickness can be roughly estimated from the charts, thermistors are
spaced 2cm apart.

=TB&region=all&buoystate=active&expedition=MOSAiC&submit3=display&lang=en_US&
active-tab2=buoy

edit: Taking a wider look to view the location of the Tbuoys we can see that
the retrace is milder at the periphery, missing t68 completely. T56 looking
like it could be quite close to Polarstern.
p201 and p204 left in to help get our bearings.

I think the express train will keep running for a few days more, winds
consistently between 6 & 7 m/sec. If anything different, direction will change
from towards FJL to towards NE Greenland

Fascinating to see those buoys doubling back twice in #481. That took place
over 34.5 hours between 09:00 on 07 Jan 2019 and 19:30 on 08 Jan 2019. In a
subsequent post, uniq's animation will be cropped down to its relevant
half-hourly time frame sand compared to the temporal resolution of hourly ship
weather, 3-hourly GFS, 2-3x clustered daily S1AB, and six-hourly bow radar.

What caused the double retrace in buoy motion, did it result in severe ice
deformation around the ship, was deployed equipment damaged, can these events
be predicted in advance, are they anomalously frequent in this year's ice, what
are the consequences for melt season?

The forward-looking ice radar is about the only scientific data released during
the first four months of the Polarstern cruise, other than ship weather that
comes with severely dumbed down location coordinates.

It came as a burst in late December, got updated to Jan 9th, but went into
limbo again (despite MeereisPortal reporting downloads to Bremerhaven "several
times a day" over the ship's fast Kepler internet (which AWI continues to deny
even having).

They did not repair the Nov-Dec record on the occasion of the Jan 9th update,
nor provide the missing Oct 04-31 (because frightening levels of thin ice
motion are off-message?). The timestamp is to the second, though the radar
takes longer than this to complete its 360º sweep (of which 80º are blocked).

There are 4 forward radars visible in moored images, three on the P-deck over
the bridge and one on the very top of the mast (crow's nest) that is being
called bow ice radar here. This is mostly used for route-finding when an
icebreaker is underway, though the Norwegian N-ICE2015 also used it to capture
ice motion during the five winter/spring months it was moored to floes.

You won't ever see N-ICE2015, Chinese, or Russian expeditions (like Mr.
Federov's year on a floe) mentioned in Mosaic posts or interviews (eg #484),
only Nansen and Sheba. N-ICE2015 covered a lot of the same ground as Mosaic and
produced two dozen high quality journal papers  addressing every aspect of sea
ice a couple degrees north of Svalbard that significantly undercut the
originality of Polarstern science (to appear in 2023).

Ice radar (and the secret ship bearing and location) have by far the best time
resolution, on the order of minutes. The 2019 radar images have very irregular
timestamps generally 6 hours apart but include numerous anomalies such as 35
gaps out of 295 expected, 7 redundancies, 3 one-off times, days missing
altogether, and instances that prove the radar capture has excellent time
resolution, instances of 3, 5 and 24 minutes are provided below.

11  Dec 2019   05:57
11  Dec 2019   06:02

The full bow radar time series to date is attached as a cvs for everyone's
convenience. I made this by reading the portal's avi into ImageJ (which skips
over frame duplications), cropping out the timestamps, tiling them up, and
applying free online OCR to get the times to avoid data entry. OCR works great
these days. Another application here is to transcribe the daily 'follow Mosaic'
blurbs which they've blocked from text-copy.

It is one thing to observe and another to understand the astonishing level of
leads opening, leads slamming back together forming pressure ridges, large
blocks of ice shearing past each other and all three types of motion occurring
together and repetitively at the same and new zones of weakness.

The idea is to look at what all was going on during especially drastic episodes
of ice deformation. First though, are fractures almost instantaneous or do they
play out over hours or days? If the former, none of our open source tools have
sufficient time resolution. Only non-averaged ship weather (eg wind gusts over
100 km/hr) and ship ice radar have the necessary minute-scale resolution.

However it turns out that most of the events play out over 3-4 days. That gives
~14 ice radar frames, 24 GFS-nullschool Arctic Ocean weather displays, maybe 6
relevant S1AB 41 m images, 42 sailwx condition posts, and 72x3 tracking points
of the three close-in deformation proxy buoys.

In terms of spatial resolution mis-match, the bow radar is 10 m/pxl so similar
to buoy location precision with S1AB at 400% enlargement barely compatible. At
maximal scale, nullschool GFS has a resolution of 2094 m/pxl, meaning the green
location circle only moves noticeably after major Polarstern displacements like
the one underway this coming week, with wind streamlines taking the PS towards
the Barents via the FJL/Svalbard gap.

Thus the release of 1-minute bow radar would be excessive but six-hourly is
sub-optimal versus  1-hourly (matches weather readings) or 3-hourly (matches
GFS releases). The avi media files are not being prepared properly, meaning
three times the time resolution need not result in a larger download archive.

The scientific value of the archive would greatly benefit from regular time
sampling, disclusure of the radar wavelength, removal of bulk ice pack rotation
(ie use of bow-stern coordinates, not ship vote), clarification of UTC vs
changing ship time vs fixed CET, radial contrast improvement (too bright off
the bow, too dim elsewhere), zonal unsharp mask (to improve focus of periphery,
placement of rounded-off timestamps in a dark lower corner, subdivision of the
distance scale, cropping to reasonably lit and focused regions, and coordinated
ice thickness and surface elevation overflights.

If the white lines indeed represent pressure ridges (or growing surface
roughness lineations), there has been prodigious damage to the FYI surface.
This could greatly affect the coming melt season if elevation barriers
fragment, delay or prevent melt pond drainage, in turn keep albedo low and
insolation high. (Alternatively, melt ponds could drain more rapidly if new
fractures from ice motion provide drainages.)

The last two-frame animation shows the dramatic complexification of the ice
surface around the Polarstern between 01 Nov 2019 and 09 Jan 2020. The
four-attachment limit means the whole avi movie has to go in another post.

Well, yes. But the star Polaris aka Alpha Ursae Minoris is usually called the
North Star in English, nordstjernen in Danish but polstjernen in Norwegian and
pólstjarnan in Icelandic, étoile polaire in French and polyarnaya zvezda in
Russian and réalta thuaidh ("star of the north") in Gaelic. Interesting how
some nations are more precise than others (The North Star always points to the
north, i.e. 100% accuracy, but the Pole Star points only towards one of the two
poles, a disappointing and totally useless  50% "accuracy").

Below, all 252 bow ice radar frames are concatenated into a single image
running from Nov 1st to Jan 9th at 36 fps (50% faster than movie film). The
frames are about 6 hours apart. Thus the 70 days (1680 hrs or 100,800 min or
6048000 seconds of actual elapsed time have been collapsed to 7 seconds of mp4
video, which is a speed-up of 864,000-fold relative to a person standing on the
bow watching the ice move. Glacial motion of Jakobshavn and Petermann have been
depicted many times at similar rates on their respective forums.

The timestamp has been lowered to wasted space next to the bow-stern axis
scale. Blurred areas on the periphery have been cropped away for a better fit
of file dimensions to forum constraints. Dim areas have been preferentially
brightened with linear, gamma and adaptive local contrast correction and focus
sharpened with slight unsharp mask.  The initial size of 90MB reduces after
conversion of ImageJ to 18 MB avi to a final very reasonable 4.3MB mp4, thanks
to free online cloudconvert.com by Munich’s Lunaweb GmbH).

Ice movement can sometimes be seen more easily in a fast inverted image; that
is provided at 48 fps with more periphery removed. Be sure to set the
controller to loop and move the mouse off the mp4.

One surprising aspect throughout this imagery is that leads close up before
they can freeze over, even at very low air temperatures (-30ºC). Open leads
historically have been viewed as important direct conduits between ocean heat
and its loss in winter to the atmosphere, with refreezing reducing but not
totally blocking the effect until an insulating snow cover can build up.

Here none of the leads have stayed open more than a day or two before slamming
shut, with refreezing and heat loss having minimal time frames in which to
operate. However we don't know how representative the bow radar area is
relative to the overall ice pack. Notably, giant lead fields in the Beaufort
can stay open for weeks before freezing over.

Re: MOSAiC news English Transcript of Audio Logbook

« Reply #491 on: January 12, 2020, 08:17:40 PM »
As promised earlier here is an English transcript of the Audio logbook that can
be found on the MOSAIC website and is otherwise only available in German. It
was posted on the MOSAIC website on Wednesday 8 January, but the recording
itself was made on December 14 last year just before the changeover between the
first and second leg teams. So it doesn't contain anything particularly
newsworthy.

For the record here it is.

MOSAICAUDIOLOGBOOK CHAPTER 9: TEAM CHANGE


Commentator: Artic Drift the Audio logbook.

Markus Rex:  We have now coms as far as eighty-six degrees twenty-six minutes
North on the direct route to the North Pole [Ed.: The Polar Stern was at this
latitude on either late on 10th or early 11th December]

Commentator: In the Arctic wintery temperatures are gradually being seen. The
researchers of the MOSAIC expedition are currently measuring temperatures down
as far as minus 30 Celsius. Markus Rex, leader of the expedition explains what
further falls in temperature are expected  in the coming days and months.   

Markus Rex: It’s certainly becoming colder as MOSAIC transitions into winter
and just in the last few days we reached the lowest temperature record of the
season with minus 31 Celsius. Before that the temperatures were mostly above
minus 30 or sometimes just touching it. That’s to be expected. The lowest
temperatures will be recorded sometime in the period between January and March.
The lowest temperatures usually occur in February.

Commentator: In comparison to the expedition of  Fridtjof Nansen, who carried
out a similar drift experiment in 1893, these temperatures can be considered
warm. The big differences to that time can be traced back to the ice cover and
climate change

Markus Rex: Back then Fridtjof Nansen measured temperatures of minus 51 and 52
degrees Celsius at this time of year. Those are temperatures that we won’t
observe on this expedition. From all the temperature measurements that we have
obtained from automatic drift systems in the arctic we know that temperatures
under minus forty-five degrees Celsius practically don’t occur anymore. That’s
clearly an indication of change the Arctic is not the same one that Fridtjof
Nansen saw then. Our ice is much thinner, it is only half as thick and is
therefore very dynamic and full of cracks. The temperatures are higher as well.
Climate warming isn’t the first thing that springs to mind, but the change is
omnipresent  in the ice and in the temperatures, even if it is  taking place at
very low temperatures. It’s not so easy to explain how temperatures below minus
50 could occur in Fridtjof Nansen’s time. After all, even in Fridtjof Nansen’s
time the temperature of the ocean under us was only minus one point five to
minus  one point seven Celsius, then the water freezes. In other words, we have
an enormous underfloor heating system under us an enormous heat reservoir only
a thin layer of ice separates from this heat reservoir. The low temperatures
are also affected by the ice being thinner and because the ice was thicker in
Fridtjof Nansen’s time. He had a thicker insulating layer between the warm
ocean and the low temperature air. Our ice layer is thinner, so more heat comes
out of the ocean and therefore such low temperatures can’t be reached anymore.

Commentator: The measurements in different scientific experiments are also
making progress. Although there is no perceptible difference between “daytime”
and “night-time” during the polar night most of the team keep regular working
hours. Despite this there are also measurements that are made at night or round
the clock.

Markus Rex:
For the most part, we keep usual working hours, simply because the participants
also need to take breaks, so we decided to synchronise. But naturally we also
want to carry on research round the clock and, in several instances, we are
active 24 hours a day. There are scientific reasons for this because there are
certain species of organisms in the ecosystem  that have daily rhythms in lower
latitudes, migrating back and forth between deeper and shallower layers of
water in the course of a day. This raises the question of what these organisms
do during the polar night when there is no variation in conditions, when there
is no daylight? To investigate that we naturally have to keep making
measurements throughout the night.

Our remote-controlled underwater robot is looking at underwater life in the
ocean throughout every twenty-four-hour period and I am very curious to know
what the results will be. There are really quite a lot of activities that take
place during the night. There are automatic instruments that measure
continuously anyway and we also have our tethered balloon that takes samples
from the 200 metre layer of  the atmosphere above the earth’s surface
throughout the night and there are also ocean instruments that operate through
the night.

Commentator: The thickness of the ice cover increases continuously during the
arctic winter. As a result, larger and heavier equipment can now be brought
onto the ice from the icebreaker. This is necessary, in order to prepare for
future stages of the expedition, especially when supplies and the exchange of
personnel and materials can only take place by air,  which requires a landing
strip.

Markus Rex:  As the winter progresses the ice has become thicker. It is still
dynamic but, as expected, it is becoming thicker. As a result we have now been
able to put our largest and heaviest piece of equipment onto the ice. Our
“Pistenbully” [Ed.: also known in English as a snow-groomer] that we use to
move other large pieces equipment  and in particular that will be used to
prepare the landing strip, that will be used to make changeover between the
third and fourth legs of the expedition in March or April. In April, I myself
will be here again in April. I have appointed two very experienced colleagues
as expedition leaders who will hold the reins in the meantime. In April when I
will be back again and  will need the landing strip to get here and the
Pistenbully is essential for making it. The ice is now so thick that we were
able to put this 16 ton machine onto the ice without the ice creaking and
cracking noises and it’s now operating securely.

Commentator: The first leg of the Expedition is now at an end. A new research
team is moving into the Polarstern and will carry out the measurements during
the next Phase of the expedition. The infrastructural prerequisites for this
have been established.

Markus Rex: We have completely finished the construction of the ice camp for
our research city on the ice. Every instrument is now in deployment on the ice
..-and working.  We experienced setbacks in the meantime, because instruments
fell over or broke down as a result of ice drift causing repeated opening of
leads and the formation of pack ice ridges. We have now overcome these
setbacks. Everything is functioning and our 30 metre meteorological mast is
standing again. Actually, it is only 23 metres high because the rest of it was
destroyed, but that won’t affect the measurements, so we will be able to hand
over a very well-functioning research city to the participants in the next leg
of the expedition.

Commentator: In the course of changing over the teams there was a delay. The
Russian supply icebreaker that was carry the new team into the arctic was
unable to leave Tromsø harbour because of a storm.

Markus Rex: Just after it set off the Dranitsyn ran into a very, very severe
storm. She had to wait in the Tromsø fjord because she couldn’t risk being
exposed to the raging waters. There were wind gusts of Storm force twelve. No
one would choose to expose themselves to that. So, the  Dranitsyn waited in the
fjord for  five days.

Commentator: The Mosaic expedition didn’t miss out on Advent or Christmas
either. Despite a shortage of supplies the team enjoyed a sweet surprise.

Markus Rex: On the first and second Sunday in Advent we got chocolate. On St.
Nicolaus day [Ed.: 6 December] we all got a little bag with a surprise gift.
All of this was extremely pleasing, because the ship had run out of chocolate
earlier and we were all extremely happy to get a bag with Christmas cookies,
chocolate and all the other nice things. Pretty Christmas decorations were also
put up in the messrooms and a Christmassy atmosphere developed.

Commentator: The expedition leader Markus Rex is now returning home will only
come on board again in one of the later legs. He is handing over on site
responsibility to his colleague Christian Haas.

Markus Rex: Now that the first phase of the expedition has been very
successfully concluded, I can return home for a couple of weeks with a good
conscience. I will fly back here to take over the leadership again at the
beginning of April, possibly even the end of March. I will be with the ship
till the end of June. Then I will have another four weeks at home and from the
end of July until the end of October I will take over the reins here on board
again. In the various periods in between I have appointed very experienced
colleagues as expedition leaders and I have great confidence that they will
direct the operations here extremely well and competently, so that the
expedition will be able to carry on making measurements continuously throughout
the year in a uniform manner without any interruptions.

Commentator:
In the next instalment of “Arctic Drift” the new on-site expedition leader
Christian Haas will tell us about his impressions and current events in the
arctic.

Mosaic released a helpful observational ice thickness/ice surface elevation map
in the context of describing a temporary landing strip on the port side. The
ice proved thick enough to support the tracked Piston Bully needed to plow it.
A longer strip that the Polar-5,6 planes can actually land on will be made in
mid-February.

The ice thickness is measured by a towed electromagnetic induction sensor (of
salinity); the surface elevation by lidar (called ALS for airborne laser
scanner). The thickness was about 1.25 m, what they had expected at the time of
the Oct 4th mooring. This is also very close to inferences in posts above based
on cryo2smos weekly ice thickness reports (from calibrated satellite freeboard
and dielectric).

Note that pressure ridge jumbles are considerably thicker (whiter) but they
lack mechanical strength, contain considerable air, and melt very differently
from true multi-year ice, a perennial misunderstanding on the melt season and
piomas forums.

Once again, the bluish DEM depicting ice heights does not come with a scale.
This is unfortunate because it would help with interpretation of oblique bow
ice radar. Thin white lines indicate lat lon but they were not labelled!
However these are probably 87.0º and 114.º given the date (which itself is
uncertain but probably January 6th or somewhat earlier).

The overlay shows bow ice radar of the same date out to 2.5 km (dotted circle).
Because of possible rfi (radio frequency interference) and separate dedicated
instrumental coverage of the selected floe in the deployment area, the bow
radar omits about 80 degrees of its normal coverage. A similar radar on
N-ICE2015 provided full 360º coverage.

Mosaic released a second interesting image obtained by TLS (terrestrial laser
scanning) which is lidar from elevated ground stations (a 3m tripod mounted on
pressure ridges). An area of approximately 1 sq km can be mapped repeatedly
with highly accurate ranges, heights and geo-referencing.

Areas behind objects are concealed from the light beam, casting shadows. Once
the model is built from combined scans, it can be rotated interactively in open
source software within a web page. Only a still is provided here. It's not
clear how much of the area covered by bow radar has been imaged with TLS.

The moon has some unfamiliar attributes at very high latitude: it is bright
enough under clear skies to read a newspaper and see colors, reflecting well
off snow and ice and not setting for two weeks out of each month. The bright
moon-lit scene provided on Jan 10th supplements the TLS and contradicts the
long-playing sob story of researchers working for months in total darkness.

The ship's directional searchlights can illuminate a broad scene continuously
but how far depends on their angle and objects in the way. Regardless, no
searchlight or moonlight photos of the bow radar region have been released.
With some control points out on the ice, the changing heights of the web of
pressure ridges could have been estimated. However this is better done
quantitatively from helicopter lidar and em bird as in the first image below.

The growth of the web of pressure ridges between Nov 1st and Jan 9th is shown
in #488 above and and 2x enlargement below. How much of daily and special ice
motion events was supplementally documented by ALS, TLS or ordinary photography
is not known.

Mid-winter on the ice creates special safety issues (ie medevac for serious
accidents and health problems) and logistical problems concerning fuel, food,
and personnel exchange. These are at their worst in late winter when the ice is
expected to be too thick for icebreaker access

leg 2/3 mid-February 2020, commercial Russian icebreaker Admiral Makarov
arrives
leg 3/4 mid-April 2020, airplane personnel exchange, no fuel or food delivered:
ice too thick
leg 4/5 mid-June 2020, research icebreaker Oden from Sweden arrives
leg 5/6 mid-August 2020, research icebreaker Xuelong II from China arrives

The expedition started on September 20th 2019 in Tromsø; it will finish on
October 14th 2020 in Bremerhaven. Allowing two weeks for transits, this results
in a full year of experimental coverage (though not exactly of the 'same' floe
as it is ever-changing due to months already of almost daily ice
rearrangements.)

Polarstern Update:

-+- The easiest way to follow the incredible effects of a prolonged sub-gale
force tailwind on Polarstern drift — westward at almost a tenth of a degree of
longitude per hour and a tenth of latitude per day — is to simply scan the
hourly online MET columns.

Wind in the 8-12 m/s range with 80º-100º bearing will push the ship towards the
FJL-Svalbard gap. But this weather is moderating and perhaps reversing towards
the end of the forecast period. The Polarstern has not seen storms coming up
from the North Atlantic unlike N-ICE2015 which was beset by them from January
on.

Then, by using MET's latest lat lon figures and UTC hour, initialize GFS
nullschool, and follow its forecast out a few days with ‘shift-k’. GFS has been
surprisingly accurate this fall and winter even though it does not appear to
have ingested nor assimilated in situ buoy and ship weather data.

GFS gives an immediate picture — and explanation — of the latest Polarstern
drift and a prediction of Polarstern position five days out. 'Passing lows'
have limited explanatory powers. There haven't been any of note --  the lowest
hPa since September 20th was an unremarkable 992.6 on Nov 16th. (The GAC
cyclone bottomed out at 962 hPa with peak sustained winds of 130 km/h.) Drift
is determined by near-surface winds, ice sails and edges, and resistance from
keels. The current run has to do with strong southern winds off Siberia, not
cyclonic lows.

https://www.awi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/MET/PolarsternCoursePlot/
psobsedat.html
https://tinyurl.com/uwb9q9p (loads nullschool at 87.3 106.7 on 20-01-13 at
15:00)

-+- Hourly MET reporting from the ship to ECMWF has not improved as eight gaps
occurred in the last week, most recently 20-01-12 01:00.  Sometimes gaps can be
repaired from sailwx. The problem is not plausibly in collection (sensors down)
but with failed transmission (ie no redial).

-+- Bow radar coverage resumed out to midnight on Jan 12th but with 10 gaps in
the 6-hourly coverage and only 4 new images and no infill of earlier gaps.
Significant new ice shearing can be seen on the central-starboard side. Wind
speeds have been fairly high but steady with no noticeable gradient or
curvature.

Perhaps certain ship operations are incapable with ice motionimage capture and
the associated radar operations have higher priority. It is certainly not
storage — a single consumer-grade 256 GB SSD card could capture an entire year
of images at one minute intervals. Transmission ashore cannot be an issue
either given the pipeline. The Polarstern is not actually capturing that much
data — all of leg1 fits on a single 20 TB external drive. Samsung sells a 768
TB rack of SSDs, enough for a half dozen Mosaic expeditions.

The first compound mp4 shows ice motion that preceded the remarkable double
retrace that Uniq documented with three close-in buoys in post #481 above. The
dramatic buoy drift reversals surprisingly did not have much effect on ice
deformation in front of the bow. Instead a major ice movement cycle occurred a
few days earlier as the buoys and Polarstern were drifted smoothly along. This
suggests that the causes of ice motion are complex, not entirely local and
possibly regional (or even basin-wide) meaning knowledge of the near-ship
stress field will prove insufficient.

This early January sequence of events makes for an interesting case study of
shear sliding and sticking. The lower section C is largely stationary; the
upper section A is quite active. The B-B’ unit initially moves back and forth
between A and C but later B’ gets stuck on A. As A-B’ move rapidly to the left,
B’ slams into its former partner B and deforms.

-+- S1AB radar coverage resumed on 13 Jan 2020 at 03:35 after missing Jan 8, 9
10, and 12 (making those dates very unfavorable for joint coverage of ice
motion). This is the 189th image in the 84 days since mooring. The Polarstern
is currently not far enough north at 87.3º to be in the pole hole of Sentinel
satellites at 87.8º which is ~60 km closer to the pole.

The exit track of the Kapitan Dranitsyn is still highly visible. It arrived on
Dec 12th and left the 17th at 14:30 ship time  which is 12:30 CET which is
11:30 UTC [not making this up]. The KD possibly returned in part via the same
lead it created coming in.

At prevailing temperatures, the entrance lead would have refrozen over the five
day stay at the Polarstern but the return trip might have damaged the newly
formed ice. The KD's beam is 27 m wide. Pack ice compression episodes should
have closed the lead by now leaving a pressure ridge composed of re-jumbled new
ice.

This unusual sequence of events has left a white scar on Sentinel-1AB radar
that represents strong radar reflection from rough-textured ice (Mie rather
than Rayleigh elastic scattering). The line can serve as a detector of shear
and rotation at a regional scale far from the Polarstern. This can be seen
already in the Jan 1st to Jan 13th comparison below: an left-center offset is
visible.

    drift update jan6-14, less meandering. S1B from jan13.

Looking at sailwx, the GFS wind forecast driving Polarstern drift, the pole
hole beyond 87.54º associated with Sentinel's orbit and swath, and the
competition for its operating mode, it is safe to say we can say goodbye to
open source satellite coverage for the foreseeable future.

The collection of 191 image links and precision Polarstern locations for the
expedition to date are attached as a csv. The records also direct to the GFS of
that date at the appropriate lat lon.

The ship's radar has also fizzled out again. While restricted to an area of ~20
sq km of a 7.1 million sq km  Arctic Ocean, it provides by far the best picture
of local ice motion. The quality seems worse than similar radar on the RV Lance
and some of the processing steps here are ill-advised.

It's not clear what is causing the erratic stop-start coverage. It's at the
point of ruining the scientific value. This was not some impulsive impromptu
hack of navigation radar ... capture is explicitly discussed in the pre-trip
planning document:
Quote

    In addition to the installations in laboratories in the ship, different
    kinds of instrumentation are installed at suitable positions outside on
    deck and along the railing of Polarstern. Most
    prominent are opportunities to use the P-deck (observational deck) and the
    crow’s nest for
    installations that require a view of the sky or access to higher altitudes:
    • Radar for sea ice movement and deformation...


The scenes intrinsically blur and darken in proportion to their distance from
the rotating mast radar beam. The former can't really be fixed by unsharp mask
and the like. However contrast in the over-exposed bow area and under-exposed
periphery can be evened out. Usually a radial transparency mask would be used.
However it's easier and works about as well to apply a bimodal contrast LUT
followed by mild adaptive contrast even though that doesn't act radially. The
initial underlying image is unfortunately zoned, the scale bar off-center,
blacks not black and so on. The goal here is to retain image quality after a 2x
enlargement and improve clarity farther out from the bow.

Meereisportal posted another drift segment colored by velocity using software
not up to the task: there is no indication of time or dates and dithered colors
are uninterpretable (ie do not correspond to anything in the palette).

The color jumble may be due to using one-minute GPS time resolution which is
much more than can be displayed. They may have fitted a rolling 4-point cubic
curve or spline and then colored continuously, with the jumble resulting from
downscaling compression.

Why not just use GoogEarth where color and segments can be controlled without
code and the data is shareable as kmz? Or Uniq's animation which is a lot
livelier and carries the essential data within its frames?

The main use of one-minute GPS time would be determination of fine-scale
acceleration (slope of the velocity curve). The icepack's inclination is always
to decelerate because of frictional drag of ice keels with seawater underneath.
This resistance goes up like the cube so whatever the wind, the icepack will
top out at a very low terminal velocity, perhaps ~1.5 km/hr.

Since Mosaic measures the near-surface wind at co-temporal intervals, that
could have displayed on the same graph, not as separately but integrally as a
height. We cannot fix the graphic because Mosaic doesn't share either parameter
at the resolution at which they are measured, ie the sailwx wind is an hourly
average.

Ship drift velocity cannot respond instantly to an applied force but only with
a lag as the icepack gets up to speed. Wind direction is an additional
complexity factor. It's been steady since 01:00 on 20-01-09 which presents a
great opportunity to isolate variables. Is the drift independent of wind
direction or do issues like immovable land boundaries along the CAA give rise
to anisotropy?

In terms of scientific co-visualization, ship and wind bearing need to be
displayed cyclically. That is, 360º and 0º are the same, not opposite extremes
as on the MET graph. That suggest a color wheel ROYGBV where red and violet are
perceptually equated, the wheel being displayed as a linear background gradient
along the time axis. The more common wind rose display has lost track of its
time coordinate. However looking down the time axis, the bearing could be
displayed as angle, wind as length and velocity as color.

Despite the coming unavailability of high resolution lat lon from Sentinel, the
three close-in P-buoys provide the Polarstern's location as shown in the base
frame below. Assuming the geometric relations between the ship and buoys are
constant, it's still tricky to extract future lat lon numbers for the PS.
Graphically, circles of fixed radius from P201, P204 and P207 intersect at the
PS.

The mp4 shows that the mad dash west and north will morph into a strong move
back east and south on the outer highly curved edge of a moderate cyclone.

The overall ice drift on the Eurasian side has been indecisive this year; Fram
export has been good but is originating on the eastern Canadian side of the
icepack. The Kara Sea is injecting its ice north of the FJL-Svalbard line again
but not as much as a year ago.

Not understanding what is meant by "*3.6 is only 0.76km/h". Otherwise seems
like either the buoys are not reporting in m/s as we thought (knots?) or the
scale on the Mosaic map was miscalculated or it's in different units than
labelled.

Meanwhile, the Polarstern is out of S1AB range. Mosaic also has access to
various quasi proprietary radar data but those satellites too would be in
near-polar orbit and not necessarily have a smaller pole hole than Sentinel.

Bow radar is not reporting either. The Polarstern has been in double digit m/s
winds for 31 hours now which may be causing a lot of disruptive ice motion and
downtime for deployed equipment. That could be the reason for non-reporting;
"Follow Mosaic" is posting silly nonsense too.

    Highest P204   2019-Nov-18 85.86  121.25   0.424m/s  1.53km/h


That date had high winds but not much bow radar ice motion. However the passing
cyclone picked up again on 2019-Nov-21 causing the worst icepack disruption of
the trip, gif below. Sailwx reported mild winds over this time frame; P204 etc
were moving quite slowly according to the m/s column in
2019P204_300234068916790_proc.csv

The explanation is at GFS-nullschool: the ice was being 'drawn and quartered'
at the Polarstern's location.

Apologies for being lazy:  0.212*3.6 is only 0.76km/h  (edited previous post)

I checked the buoy data. Drift is in m/s
From P207

2020-01-15T02:30:25,87.4702,103.3356,0.135

first)
divided by 1799 secs = 0.13409m/s

close enough for me.
No data for our favourite Pbuoys today so far so I have added T56 and T62 to

Winds are a-changing and the Polarstern is heading back south and shortly to
the east, where GFS has it caught in another 'drawn and quartered' stress
situation very similar to the 21 Nov 2019 pattern above.

The bow radar archive is not currently updating. The ship will remain outside
of radar satellite range though conditions can still be monitored by wide-swath
/low resolution tools such as Ascat and proxies such as the three close-in
P-buoys.

The persistent wind off Siberia that has brought the frozen-in Polarstern so
far west and north towards the Svalbard-FJL also strongly affected the icepack
in that area. Despite appearances on AMSR2 and Smos-Smap, this has nothing to
do with intrusion of Atlantic Water, delayed freezing, early melt, or thinning
ice (though those are all important in their own right).

Instead, the massive rifting of wind-blown ice is caused by export into the
Barents. Watch the Svalbard island (Kvitøya) marked with the rectangular black
dot. A large piece of light-colored ice can be seen swinging around into the
Barents. Kara Sea ice is also moving chaotically but not systemically intruding
into the Arctic Basin. There is also substantial advection of ice Fram-ward.

The slipstream (wake) of ice moving past small islands is very distinctive and
can be tracked for many months in some years. It is a different type of feature
than a buoy or virtual buoy in that it has linear extent similar to this year's
clear boundary between FYI and MYI on Ascat.

Since the buoys are more or less drifting in tandem with each other and the
Polarstern, it suffices to look at a single close-in buoy such as P204. Despite
some glitches, its database has excellent quality with over 4600 half-hourly
reads of position. The basic statistics are shown in the graph below.

A lot more could be done such as acceleration, correlations with latitude and
longitude, and the relationship with hourly sailwx wind speed and bearing.

It is also easy to make a Google Earth trace of the 4600 line segments
hexadecimal-colored by speed bin (GE uses hexadecimal, with transparency
controlled by the alpha channel AA in #AARRGGBB 0-255 hex). Maximal value (255
dec, FF hex) means fully opaque.. The underlying kml provides a small
distributable, extendable and scalable text file. Even though it refers to a
buoy rather than the ship, its very high positional and temporal accuracies
allow it to track the Polarstern's drift very satisfactorily.

Eyeballing the drift chart it seems acceleration/deceleration is easing off as
the ice gets thicker.
drift update with change in direction as noted above. Pbuoys are back but
reporting later so the 2 Tbuoys stay in.

    acceleration/deceleration is easing off as the ice gets thicker

Certainly plausible. Maybe one of the SIMBA buoys would provide an ice
thickness track. Correlation isn't causation but it's a good start. More
ambitiously, integrate bearing (wind direction) from sailwx: might be harder to
go north because the pack is run up against Greenland.

Here is some machinery that plots the same track colored for either speed or
acceleration. It could be animated, tediously. I haven't binned the speeds into
colors yet, just changed every tenth one as a marker. Meant to do 24 hr
intervals (48 lines of P204 data) but did 40 bins instead which gives 115 line
segments. (Any interval can be set rapidly; it is just modular arithmetic +
sort on the count field).

This just uses lon lat sandwiched in between default kml gibberish. A segment
needs two consecutive lon lat (from adjacent rows) followed by 'fill down' in a
spreadsheet. A flatfile database can't do this, that's the difference between
db and ss.

Attached are the slightly dated P204 database to from 10 Oct 2019 to 15 Jan
2020, the spreadsheet column magic that makes it work and the concatenated
source (kml is insensitive to carriage returns etc so it compacts well even
before compression to kmz).

Update: bow radar just came in with 16 new frames (and 1 new gap) bringing the
archive up to Jan 17th! There is a substantial new instance of a large plate
sliding 110 m along a previously established (Jan 1st fracture, small slip Jan
6th) shear line on the port side without snapping back or a lead opening
(frames 9-10, another possible consequence of thicker and mechanically stronger
ice. There are various other motions that don't involve large displacements.
Recommended: open the avi in ImageJ as it has very convenient subsetting and
speed controls.

drift update, jan14-18, with a burst of speed heading away from the pole,
perhaps due to less resistance. Will look at adding wind speed/direction to the
plot.

Bow radar is steadily updating now. The ice is still shifting around in fairly
minor ways, first port and then starboard; it is hard to predict if any of
these are disruptive to experimental setups. The ship is currently at 87.4 98.3
20-01-19 15:00 3 70 in calm air but in a saddle of ice being pulled this way
that according to GFS may show up in dramatic ice radar tomorrow. It does not
look like S1AB coverage will resume next week.

The provisional bow radar availability mage is generated by the code below,
concatenated over all 00:00 UTC locations from 27 Oct to 19 Jan. It displays
the gaps in ice radar archive (red) with lat lon as provided by drifter P204.
The ice radar archive does not cover October (4 blue days).

As Uniq notes, all the nrt databases are raw nuisances in terms of missing and
glitchy entries, so integrating two of them involves a fair amount of editing
of spreadsheets, grepping text and coddling of GEP kml.

Next up: integration with the velocity and acceleration proxy Polarstern track
databases for an all in one extendable GIS-interactive scalable rotatable
display with optional quantitative coupled data capture. It is easy to spoof
lat lon slightly so different data types lie side by side.

  • extendable: update path exists for incremental incoming data
  • gis-interactive: provided by multiple co-registered layer checkboxes in
    GoogEarth
  • scalable: provided by GoogEarth display
  • orientable: provided by GoogEarth display to fit satellite views
  • numeric data: view kml as text, reconstitute as spreadsheet.

Very people on the forums download or use free and easy double-click viewing
tools such as ImageJ, Gimp, QuickTime or Google Earth which limits
effectiveness given forum limitations.

A row of the bow radar database and its sandwich code looks like this:

    handbrake turn

And that's with 30-minute frames. Would there be even more swerves on the
10-minute buoys?

The wind field out there has had a quite unusual configuration and it's about
to get weirder in the next hours if GFS 3-hourly can be believed. The final
frame on the animation is an hour later than the link below; the second frame
of the slide show is 24 hours later

https://earth.nullschool.net/#2020/01/19/0300Z/wind/isobaric/1000hPa/
orthographic=-40.24,92.69,3000/loc=97.400,87.400

Meanwhile action has picked up on the Polarstern bow radar, with a new feature
appearing in the last 12 hours on the port side but a couple km from the ship
(far right). Quite a few missing scenes were patched yesterday to the point
2020 now has a complete 6-hourly record. October is still missing entirely; the
ice may have been too flat then to give a good radar reflection. Again, it was
not a good idea to conflate bearing with the ship-axial coordinate system.

The imagery can be improved quite a bit by fitting a cubic LUT to the initial
contrast that brightens the dark edges and darkens the bow brights, then
applying adaptive contrast followed by slight unsharp mask. This evens out the
overall contrast, improves it locally and takes off some of the blur from the
return signal that broadens with reflector distance. The negative sometimes
provides more clarity and it's easy to pair both (2x enlargement below).

The Polarstern was within lat lon range of both Sentinel A and B this morning
but no shots were taken for unknown reasons. If Mosaic has ordered up radar
from other satellites, they're not sharing it. The last available S1AB scene
dates to 05:54 on Jan 14th; the ship will soon be drifting deeper into the pole
hole.

'Follow Mosaic' on Jan 18th reports on multi-faceted studies of a pressure
ridge (Fort Ridge) whose location is not disclosed. It is up to 7m thick in
places. Note this has to be measured directly rather than inferred from
freeboard because voids affect density and ice may be held up locally rather
than be at buoyancy equilibrium. The ROV has not yet imaged the keel from
below.

Seasonal evolution of ridges is quite complex. Four were studied for six months
during N-ICE2015 but even then the question remains of how representative they
are of the whole Arctic basin:

This is getting interesting. We may be getting to the bottom of the barrel in
terms of resolution though if the Polarstern is actually recording 1-minute
GPS, they could be seeing yet more squiggles, ie icepack motion may be
~fractal. Some of these buoys can be reprogrammed from afar to take more
frequent GPS though few would consider it because of battery life and iridium
expense.

Below is a provisional (or slightly less) run at displaying acceleration. With
speed, we are actually displaying velocity with color + track because the
direction part comes for free as tangent to the track.

There didn't seem to be enough decimals in the 30-min velocities to difference
them meaningfully to 30 minute accelerations. It seemed better to averaged over
30*8 = 4 hours or more before  differencing, coloring by bin, and displaying
using first lat lons (because average lat lon won’t lie on the actual track).

Somewhere along the line my P204 spreadsheet got behind the times and very
confused so this will take a restart with a fresh download and rethink of the
vector direction aspect (same direction as applied force so would give the
latter, so in effect fitting circle at each point along the velocity track).
This is an easy spreadsheet calculation from rolling triples of points and
Menger curvature (see wiki) though it requires a prior haversine of points n-1
and n+1 distance.

    dip in ocean temperatures on jan2-3?

It seems internally supported so not plausibly an instrument artifact. 'Follow'
said at one point that the returning Atlantic Water core was still at ~300m and
that would be warmer, not colder. Wind mixed layer out here in the middle of
nowhere (86.8 117.0) in 4000 m deep water that was largely ice covered even in
mid-summer? Neither tidal mixing nor tidal currents have any applicability at
this location.

What are nearby CTD buoys saying about salinity on those dates and how broad an
area can be shown to be affected by O-buoys? Double diffusion staircases are
mostly across the Lomonosov ridge in the Makarov and Canadian basins with only
one known in the Amundsen Basin. How about a turbulent diffusive convective
eddy with a thermohaline finger intrusion providing layer mixing?

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-15486-3
https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JC014368

https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016JC012419

Meanwhile, back at near-term Polarstern drift, GFS shows a moderate persistent
anti-cyclone bouncing around the basin with the ship assuming various
orientations wrt its circulation. This pattern is fairly typical for the
current strongly positive NAO (which however is predicted to dissipate by the
end of the month).

Recent repairs to the Polarstern's bow radar archive have greatly improved the
scientific value of 4x-daily coverage. There is still hope that the 22
remaining gaps will be filled; the 8 off-hour oddities will probably not be
fixed, nor will any of October be furnished.

Hardly a day goes by without multiple areas of ice showing significant
slippage. The last 36 hours though have not been notably disruptive near the
ship. The problem is scaling out the bow region (including ice camp which is
studied separately) to a broader view of icepack motion: is the observed ice
motion regionally representative? The ship is currently located in the pole
hole of all high resolution radar satellites so little information is
available.

Looking at the thick colors in uniq's 2nd image in #510 (ºC @ 100m), it seems
that the set of buoys provide a very convenient set of 'parallel' tracks that
can be used to simultaneously display all manner of data. That is, a buoy's lat
lon time can be spoofed with anything from weather to gaps in S1AB to peak ice
motion to acceleration to some aspect of its own measurements such as ice
thickness or salinity at depth.

It is quite feasible to have a dozen of these 'final frames' parallel the plain
vanilla velocity track of the Polarstern. Alternatively, the data can be
displayed, at least with GE, as a stack of bar graphs by increasing line width
along the equator (by setting lat to 0).

Why is the salinity decreasing with time? The thickness of the low salinity
layer is increasing - I'm going to assume that the ice is thickening and
expelling brine so I'd expect the salinity of the water below the ice to
increase. Am I missing something obvious? Does it take all year for freshwater
input from the rivers to reach equilibrium under the ice?

Maybe more influence from itp102/mosaic being close to the interface of two

"Any Ideas?" Powerful low on 1^st 963 twixt FJL/NZ would have 'called' for
water from all quarters, did PS shift?, the high over the Canadian basin side
would have 'pressed' some less saline cooler water over Lomonosov, near to but
not at the surface, the coarse ice underside creating a stable zone with a
sheer close below, may also have halted flow at depth down St. Anna trough?

    Obuoy temperature ani's for reference, 10-75m
    Tech note: scales are different

The buoy sets are slightly different too? It looks like as many as 3 could be
run without entanglement. The animation of the final frames and side-by-side
are shown below.

Looking at 'Mosaic_multisensor' to see if the Mosaic expedition had access to
other radar satellites in addition to what PolarView shows for Sentinel, it
appears the answer is no. M_m is still poorly done with no mid-course
improvements, with satellite images lacking critical access numbers, provided
dates erroneous, 48 hour applicability falsely claimed, too small choice of
scale, gratuitous rotations that make comparison of successive images
difficult, lat/lon of position not synched with  S1AB and obliteration of the
Polarstern region with the red circle. However a precise lat/lon for 0600Z can
be read off the images on days no S1AB was taken. A poorly implemented
scientific product inevitably raises questions about the rest.

The Polarstern is currently drifting west and more south 'on top' of a
meandering anti-cyclone. Actual drift is generally 'to the right' of
near-surface wind direction. Accurate latitudes are not disclosed so sailwx
will sit at "87.5" even as it declines; longitude is decreasing by 1º per 22
hrs. The inset shows "87.4" is due at about 1800Z (except that wind direction
and speed vary by the hour).

Very minor shearing is showing on the most recent day of bow radar. 'Follow'
offered a possible explanation yesterday for varying image exposure and
orientation: the radar is not gimbaled and so changes its incident angle if the
stern swings around or the bow rises/falls (as ice anchors fail). This data
could be used to uniformize the imagery but it is not disclosed, The PS also
has strain gauges welded along its hull. That data is not disclosed either.

'Despite being solidly frozen into the ice, the forces of wind and currents*
affect the ship. Depending on their directions, the Polarstern is pushed
against the MOSAIC floe or pulled away from it. The latter strains the six ice
anchors, which therefore need to be need to be monitored regularly. Today's
check showed that five anchors were properly fixed - however one needed some
additional care: Steffen and Andreas found a gap next to the 1.20 meters long
metal I-beam. They filled it up with snow and poured water inside. The mix
freezes solid almost immediately at the current temperatures of -28 °C.'

* No significant independent near-surface currents are known under ice in the
central Arctic Ocean. A paper from N-ICE2015 describes the acoustic doppler
measurement process and results; the four floes were located near the tip of
the Yermak Plateau, meaning measured small currents were affected by tides,
rising Atlantic Water boundary currents, adjacent ice edge, and passing storms;
thus it is inapplicable to the Polarstern's situation.

Thanks for checking. Just can't get the staff these days ;)
O6 75m NANs
O5 20m 75m NANs
O4 75m NANs
O3 50m NANs
O1 ok
A handy line of macid's original code takes out spurious very high(or low)
entries and NANs (not a number) which mess up the nice colours.
There are a few good entries interspersed with a lot of NANs. Maybe I can show
only those. I'll play around with it (eventually)

Would not more wealth inequality be the answer? Indentured R experts might do
staff work for peanuts.

Alternatively, a spreadsheet classifying column can finger NaN's as singletons,
doubles, triples etc. Pull up each class in turn with a sort, paste in a
weighted tuple averaging expression that brings in good date from adjacent
rows, and re-sort to initial order. This will cause a re-calc that makes the
NaN go away. That expression works equally on databases of buoys, satellite
gaps, weather misses and so on.

Just posting a close-up of a sturdy ice anchor that worked its way loose on the
Polarstern. There are six of these deployed in pairs. It's not clear whether
the anchor is bow or stern (midship is unlikely) nor what happened to its mate.
The key to having them work as matched pairs is nrt winching to take up slack
without losing the grip on the bollard.

An earlier 'Follow Mosaic' said these were improvised back in October in the
ship's machine shop after the ice was found to be too thin to really freeze
into. The massive iron shackles and sheathed hawsers are things they would have
lying about but six I-beams?

Those beams are now over a meter into solid ice yet somehow one worked its way
forward without bending or pressure-ridging the ice forward, possibly
compressing porosity channels left by brine exclusion. The I-beam is correctly
oriented for optional strength under a unidirectional load.

The Polarstern has drifted south, reaching 87.4 at 0600 on Jan 23rd a few hours
later than estimated in #518. The ship is still 290 km from the North Pole; the
closest approach being 267 km with no prospects for northward drift this GFS
week. Indeed a cyclone is foreseen swinging the ship far to the east (undoing a
lot of recent westward gains).

The Polarstern is currently 1168 km from the entrance to the Fram Strait at
80.0N 0.0E. It is outside the pole hole of S1AB but its specific coordinates
have not been imaged in the last 30 days. The area farther east, off the New
Siberian Islands, is hardly ever imaged.

The overall motion of the icepack over the last three weeks is better described
as a 'Siberian Slam' against the CAA than TransPolar Drift. Note the boundary
between FYI and MYI remains quite distinct and easy to track. Ice radar motion
in front of the bow has been negligible the last few days.

FoMo had quite an interesting post yesterday that shows the ROV is back in
action after multiple relocations. Its view of the ice underside is key to
understanding keels and mapping their evolution over time (eg erosion). We have
often wondered why buoys fail; the explanation here is mis-installation.

The Fortress area jumble was not a good choice for a buoy site, better would be
an area of flat ice without keels. However those weren't easy to find in early
October. Second, the drill hole should be protected with a temporary pvc pipe
through which the thermistor ribbon is threaded to its correct location and
then frozen in.

The ROV is quite a neat device. Let's hope they release some video rather than
just the occasional still. The only previous release was an underwater view of
the Polarstern's hull.

Here is an English translation of installment 10 of the MOSAIC podcast that is
only available in German on the MOSAIC webpage. It was posted there last
Wednesday (15. January) but mainly covers events from mid-December last year,
namely the handover from leg1 to leg 2 seen through the eyes of the leg 2
leader Christian Haas.

MOSAIC AUDIO LOGBOOK 10
 
Moderator: Audio Now    Arctic Drift – the audio logbook.

Christian Haas: Hallo, I’m  Christian Haas, I’m the project leader for leg 2.
I’m not just a researcher, I’m also head of the Sea Ice section of the
Alfred-Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven and I’m very happy to have been chosen
to take on this task.

Moderator: The next part of the Mosaic Expedition is in full swing. In the
meantime, Christian Haas has taken over Markus Rex’s post and is now the local
expedition leader for the duration of the second leg. He and the other
expedition participants were only able to reach the Ice Breaker Polarstern and
relieve the crew of the first leg after  a long and difficult journey through
the arctic.

Christian Haas: Yes, our journey began long before we reached the Polar Stern,
in fact on the 27th November in Tromsö, where we went on board the Kapitän
Dranitsyn.
There were about 60 scientists including the logistic teams and Polar Bear
lookouts as well as about 40 of the Polar Stern’s crew, the sailors that look
after us here on the Polarstern. We boarded on the 27th and sailed off
immediately, but we  only sailed about 2 miles into the fjord before we had to
drop anchor as the ship wasn’t fully prepared for the high seas: because of
this we had to lash all the containers on deck and store all the other freight
for the expedition either in the helicopter hanger or under the foredeck. Then,
sadly, there was a very bad weather forecast that predicted a big storm would
be blowing over the Barents sea that would make it too dangerous to sail. 10
metre waves were forecast and the ship is only built to withstand three or four
metre waves. Therefore, we had to wait for 6 days in the fjord, off  Tromsö, 
before we could start the trip. After that the voyage lasted 10 days, 2 days to
traverse the Barents Sea, where the waves were moderate and  most of the
passengers took it well. And then we went into the ice along its edge where we
safe from the next storm that had already sprung up, causing waves on the open
sea. Then we sailed north of Severny island [Ed.: The northernmost part of Nova
Zemlya], an island that is part of the Siberian Arctic, and set our course
North to get to the Polarstern and that took another 5 days.

Christian Haas: The voyage to the Polarstern was very, very  exciting and we
all had great expectations of getting there as soon as possible. To begin with
the journey through the ice was relatively rapid, but then from day to day it
became slower and in the end we were travelling at an average speed of only 1
knot, so that the people on the Polarstern, who were greatly looking forward to
finally being relieved, asked what we had been doing. But the Dranitsyn was
just very cautious going through the ice to avoid getting stuck and  so took 
her time to get to the Polarstern.

Moderator:  The new crew also had to get used to conditions in the arctic. The
ice breaker supply ship Dranitsyn had to make its way in the darkness from
waypoint to waypoint until it was only a few metres away from the Polarstern
before materials and crew could be exchanged between the 2 ships.
 
(Ed.: SEE PICTURE BELOW)

Christian Haas:  The first interesting thing was that  on the first day of our
voyage there was already no daylight, so that we had to get used the darkness.
That made our first glimpse of the Polarstern in the distance, after 10 days at
sea, all the more amazing and impressive. However, because it was roughly 40
miles distant, it quickly became clear to us that what we were seeing was a
Fata Morgana, caused by reflections from air layers, which was itself an
interesting phenomenon. Then we received a delegation from the Polarstern that
came to us by helicopter from the Polarstern. One of the officers from the
Polarstern, was seconded to us. He knew the waypoints and the coordinates and
had an exact plan for how we could approach the Polarstern without colliding
with any of the buoys which make up the network of autonomic stations around us
that carry out automatic measurements. He knew a secure route for being able to
get us as close as possible to the Polarstern. This was done very
professionally and  in impressive style. The prow of the Dranitsyn approached
the stern of the Polarstern to within 6 metres, so that nothing had to be
offloaded onto the ice but instead, using the cranes of both ships,  it was
possible to transfer freight and personnel between the two ships in both
directions at the same time.

 

Christian Haas:  Despite the amazing positioning of the two ships it was
unavoidable that we did have to transfer some heavy items from the stern of the
Dranitsyn to the Polarstern via the ice.  This was done using 2 cranes in
tandem, because items on the Dranitsyn couldn’t be transferred from the aft
part of the ship to the front part. Instead, we had to offload heavy items such
as helium gas cylinders onto the ice, then they were transported from the stern
to the prow with a tracked vehicle and then they were taken up by the crane
again to lift them onto the starboard side of the Polarstern. We were very
happy, because the ice on the port side of both ships remained very stable, at
least to begin with, but on the last day a crack in the ice did appear so that
immediately after the last transfers had been completed it wouldn’t have been
possible to traverse the crack and transfer the last heavy items from the
helicopter deck to the Polarstern..

Moderator:  The expedition members could now make an on the spot appraisal of
the situation and inspect the ice floe on which they would be spending the next
months. For the first time they were able to see for themselves the cracks and
other ice structures from which until then they had only heard from their
colleagues and which had had such a strong influence on the expedition. 
Christian Haas:  We of the second leg were now very curious to have a look at
the situation on the floe and see all the changes about which we had heard so
much and from which leg 1 had had to suffer so much; in particular the cracks
that were opening all the time and the displacements that occurred. And, as if
pre-ordained, the next cracks appeared on the day of our arrival. One of our
first actions was that we had to help out. Some of the instruments, especially
the remote-controlled instruments, were standing on the ice in the covered area
called  ROV City under which a huge crack had developed, directly under the
covered area, and we had to rescue them. There was a lot of speculation about
whether the cause might have been because the Dranitsyn had to come so near to
the measurement area to access the Polarstern. But I think that it was in
general caused by the high drift speed and the strong wind that prevailed at
the time and that it was a simple deformation event, Anyway since then it’s
been the case that the ice has been very, very quiet. Indeed, actually  that
was the only deformation- or  break-up event that we ourselves experienced.
Since then the floe has quietened down a lot. We moved the remote-controlled
instruments and ROV city to a new site. But we haven’t had to reorganize
anything else simply because the ice in the immediate vicinity and in the area
where we are making measurements has remained static  and we have therefore
been able to concentrate 100 percent on our projects and our measurements and
have been able to work unhindered

Moderator: in the next installment you will find out how the new crew has
adapted to life on the Polarstern and what progress the scientific measurements
are making.

Thx psymmo7, very helpful!

    caused by the high drift speed and the strong wind that prevailed at the
    time and that it was a simple deformation event, Anyway since then it’s
    been the case that the ice has been very, very quiet. Indeed, actually 
    that was the only deformation- or  break-up event that we ourselves
    experienced. Since then the floe has quietened down a lot.

:) requires special skills in translation -- that's not at all what the ship
radar shows at the time. Note the sheared ice ramming the port side of the
Polarstern on Dec 18th as the Kap Dranitsyn was leaving.

Be sure to set the mp4 on loop to see the eyes, nose, jaws and hand of a
feeding sea monster.

There are slow days to be sure but yesterday saw some unusual action when a
large triangular piece at the 'bottom' pulled away slightly and then rejoined
at a slight displacement. This is not likely to have had any effect on ice camp
operations.

Note the oddity at the apex of the triangle: it appears as though a horizontal
layer has slid off, exposing not water but, implausibly, a lower horizontal
layer of ice. The event is not finished; we need a few frames from tomorrow.
The frames are six hours apart; there is no intermediate information.

Looking back to Nov 1st, neither of the cracks making up the triangle sides has
been active previously. This is mildly inconsistent with theories that most
events represent re-activation of previous faults and weaknesses. Some are, but
looking at the overall growth in the white lattice, new fracture lines are
steadily accruing.

False claims of aurora discovery at FoMo are exceedingly >:( to scientists who
actually work in magnetosphere physics. Given NOAA's 3-day forecast online
animation, nullschool 'space' display, and wikipedia's treatment, it's hardly
news that the aurora borealis is commonly visible at extreme northerly
latitudes. That animation is worth a look for its advanced techniques:

https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-3-day-forecast

If GFS is halfway accurate two days out, the Polarstern is about to encounter
strong ccw winds at the top of a cyclone that will take the ship far to the
east and south (ie wrong directions).

T59 may be a candidate for FoMo jan22 post. No change in the data after
2019-10-18T03:00:14
It may not be near enough to PS though.
edit: added T56 for reference, data is also very odd. edit2: that's because I
processed the heat file. I've removed it till I find out what it is.

    T59?

Mosaic installed a secret array of close-in sensors that use the radio LAN and
do not report through Iridium (ie don't show up at IABP or MeerEis). T59's
thermistor may also have gone astray in a keel. This is a second type of type
of buoy failure: still reporting but not informative, here constant
near-surface seawater temperature.

IABP today shows 97 Mosaic buoys of which 19 are no longer reporting at all and
an unknown number not reporting like T59. All 6 buoys put out in Dec-Jan 2019
by AWI from the Kapitan Dranitsyn have failed.

    Yesterday, we recognized subtle deformations of the #ice floe in the
    vicinity of #Polarstern on the ship’s radar. A logistics team went out for
    scouting: a big lead 50 m wide by 1 km long had formed along a shear zone.
    A good chance to measure energy & gas fluxes! This was the long-awaited
    “event”: the chance to measure energy and gas fluxes between the water and
    air, through the newly formed and older ice. Additionally we carried out a
    special high resolution survey of the lead with the helicopter-borne laser
    scanner. It also allowed to study the initial population of the newly
    forming ice by ice-inhabiting biota.

That's it. FoMo doesn't provide any location data (starboard side? 200 m from
bow?) nor mark up one of their own bow radar frames nor provide freeboard or
the scan. (The scientists aboard do not write these blurbs -- AWI has a staff
of 11 full-time publicists to do that.)

Based on 'subtle' and convenient access to the Polarstern, I re-examined the
bow radar images from Jan 14th on at 2.5x enlargement. Sure enough, there is
newly active minor lead abaft the port beam. The boxed feature in the mp4 has
dimension 0.50 x 0.25 km. The original avi has 80 pixels for 1000m so a 50 m
feature will only be 4 pixels wide.

It is not feasible to cover every scale from the hairline shear cracks that
tipped over the Met tower to mega leads opening off Banks Island. Various
papers have put forth power law fits to scaling but based on unsatisfactory
coverage and detail of observational data.

Much more dramatic local ice dynamics is going on at the same time farther off
the bow but getting there regularly would present time-consuming logistical
problems over rough ice. Bear guards are always needed because cooking odors
and curiosity are drawing them in from nearest natural prey sites 100's of km
away, just like inland drill sites do in Greenland. 

The minor lead being studied will freeze over in a matter of days at -28ºC.
However the real problem will coming from multiple rounds of closing and
reopening which are already underway. The final state will be closed up the
pressure ridge sense, not closed up as frozen open water. That's because
compression events take up any slack during the freezing season: the vast
majority of shear and lead events in ~3 months of bow radar have become
inactive.

Overall, the ice is too weak and its motion too extreme to accomplish very much
of what Mosaic set out to do. And it could get worse if some winter storms set
in. GFS is sticking to its prediction of rapid drift towards Wrangel Island
starting at 1800Z today. The next 24 hours of drift is suggested below. Winds
will be picking up from 6 to 11 m/s.

T63 looks like a good buoy, probably deployed on thinner ice, growth is faster
and the temperature gradient quite different for a while.

The Polarstern got caught up in strong winds to the southeast at about 06:00
this morning as GFS foresaw a few days back. The winds are not quite gale force
but will peak in the 10-12 m/s range and stay brisk for a couple of days.

Under these conditions, longitude will be gained at about a tenth of a degree
per hour; in 3 days the ship could plausibly be at 87.2 100.0.

A very dramatic lead opened off the port side, preceded by a possibly enabling
large scale shift two km off the bow. The event is still ongoing so we await
the next day of bow radar (which unfortunately has become erratic again). In
part, an old prominent slipline reopened, not entirely but with new leads
taking off at the ends.

Looking at the regional wind stress picture over this time frame, it appears
that the problem is not high wind speed per se at the ship but rather its rapid
fall-off nearby, ie the stress gradient. How far out that matters is a big
unknown, perhaps ice basinwide contiguously adjoined to the Polarstern floe (ie
rigid body motion).

I added streaming awiMet ship weather to the ice radar since that wasn't
happening at their end. It's a doable nuisance to go back to the Nov 1st start
because of almost daily gaps in hourly awiMet weather and unsynchronized
missing or unusual radar timestamps. There is enough black space to include a
small thumbnail of GFS winds at each of the 320 bow radar frames to date. The 
bow to stern length of the ship (9.4 pixels) could also be depicted.

The gradient change (especially when the air is cold!) reveals the boundary

Major fracturing and re-association of seven active ice plates continued today
as expected from winds in the 11-13 m/s range with a sharp NS gradient. The bow
radar view of 280º degrees includes the port side but not the deployed
equipment starboard area which may have been seriously disrupted as well.

Eight hours past the last frame, winds abruptly dropped to 4 m/s as the ship
came off the shoulder of the cyclone at 10 am on Jan 27th at 87.4  95.8.

The wind gradient image shows stress on the ice moderate near the pole,
increasing to a maximum near the Polarstern and very low an equal distance
farther south but all in the same direction. This results in ice moving forward
(east) at different speeds across the gradient. That is what is causing the
plate commotion as rigid ice cannot move coherently at different speeds. High
winds alone are necessary but insufficient for a steep gradient; in a more
homogenous stress field the ice pack could simply translate (modulo boundary
conditions).

The buoy tracks establish that OsiSaf, which requires two days of data
averaging and re-gridding, cannot capture motion at the relevant temporal and
spatial scales. While too few buoys are put out to accurately depict ice motion
for the Arctic Ocean overall, the buoy array could be used to patch OsiSaf
locally.

S1AB rarely covers this latitude. The Polarstern and surroundings have not been
imaged since Jan 14th but the ship did show up on the edge of 06:36 image on
Jan 27th. That will be nearly the exact time as the first image on bow radar
avi tomorrow.

The bottom image shows the jp2 and jpg versions from PolarView. The spatial
resolutions (25 pxl/km nominal) do not provide a wholly satisfactory
continuation of bow radar scale (80 pxl/km). Very little lead or ridge detail
matches. Both can have 3-4x daily coverage, though S1AB arrive in a morning
burst and bow radar evenly at 6-hr intervals.

Recent drift mostly east, a touch north, at speed.
So T56 snow depth 10-15cm, similar to the images on FoMo.

Here is an English Translation of a transcript of the latest Podcast from the
MOSAIC Website that is only available in German.

The Podcast was posted last Wednesday (January 22)  at 5:57 PM on the MOSAIC
Website (in German) - the recording itself was probably made 8. January

Instalment 11 – thick ice, four-legged visitors and slight frostbite

In the meantime, the team around the new leader of the MOSAIC-Expedition,
Christian Haas, has accustomed itself to life on the ship and to the camp on
the Ice Floe. In this instalment the Sea Ice physicist goes into detail about
the composition of the ice and how it is continuously changing. Apart from
this, Dr. Haas also reports on measurements made by other scientific
disciplines and explains how an aircraft landing-strip is made on the ice. The
continual decrease in temperatures and the ongoing polar night present further
challenges for the members of the expedition. And, this week, the camp got
another animal visit.

…..[Ed.: Just so that transcript readers don’t miss out on the atmosphere of
the podcast they should know that it is preceded and ended by sound recordings
of strong wind and creaking ice….]

Arctic Drift – The audio logbook.

Christian Haas:   At the moment we are at 87 degrees 8 minutes North. During
the MOSAIC expedition the ship this the most Northerly that the ship has been.
[Ed.: According to the positions reported on MOSAIC webpage this would date the
time that this recoding was made a being around 8. January]

Commentator: In the meantime, the leg 2  Team has adapted to arctic conditions.
The crew around the new  Expedition leader Christian Haas has familiarised
itself  with the Icebreaker  Polarstern and the condition on the home floe. Dr.
Haas himself is head of the Sea Ice Physics section of the  Alfred Wegener
Institute and can precisely explain what an ice floe is and why the ice in the
arctic is constantly changing.

Christian Haas: we are always using the term “ice floe”, but everyone probably
imagines something different under this term…and at this time of year, in the
middle of winter, there aren’t really any, anymore. When the  Polarstern
arrived here at the beginning of October, it really was the case that there
were individual ice floes drifting in the water. They were separated from each
other by water or thin ice. But the ice and the ice floe formed a unit and
could be regarded as a swimming platform.   The MOSAIC ice floe had a diameter
on the order of two to three kilometres. But since we have been here and the
winter has begun, the whole area around us has frozen solid, so that one can’t
make out individual ice floes, because the borders between them are not
visible, except with the help of Satellite data. Nonetheless it’s the case that
the ice floe isn’t a plate, it isn’t a simple uniform plate of ice, but, as
before, it regularly fractures and is displaced by shear zones. Till now we
have just had a lot of luck that such shear zones and fractures didn’t go
directly through our camp but were some distance away. Just yesterday we made
an exploratory tour with snowmobiles to the West and East and at a distance of
about two to three kilometres in each direction we found tears and shear
zones.  With that we could say that the floe is  two to three kilometres in
size, but the Northern and Southern boundaries haven’t been found yet. 

Commentator: The ice and the alterations in it are being constantly observed.
Using different kinds of measurements it is possible to completely understand
the displacement of the ice. Many researchers view these displacements as a
danger, because they can lead to interruption in their research. Others welcome
the possibility being able to  observe and analyse them directly. 

Christian Haas: The ship’s radar, that every 10 minutes makes an image of the
surroundings within a radius of 5 kilometres, helps us a lot. When one looks at
a time series of these images it’s like looking at a film of the ice movement.
Most of the time the ice is stable, but sometimes one sees shear events, where,
because of a difference in the extent of ice-drift in different regions, a part
of the floe suddenly slides by between several metres up to as much as 100
metres relative to the other part. These zones produce tears and the formation
new pack ice ridges.

Christian Haas: For most of our colleagues here the tears and the formation of
pack ice ridges are seen as a hazard, because they interrupt research. But for
us as researchers and  for the whole MOSAIC project of course it’s an important
process that we want to investigate.  This is because we want to better
understand why the ice in the arctic has declined so much during the last few
decades and to find out what processes result in the ice becoming thicker or
thinner. The growth of pack ice ridges, the deformation of the ice and the
sliding of pieces of ice on top of each other  is a very important process and
can make ice much thicker than it would become through solely as the result of
freezing through contact with the cold atmosphere. For this reason the sea ice
researchers and remote sensing experts who are involved in our project are very
thrilled to be able to observe such deformation events at first hand and to be
able to see how the ice can continuously become thicker through floes
fracturing and sliding on top of each other. 

Commentator: In the meantime, the floe ice is circa one metre thick and has
doubled in thickness since the beginning of the expedition in October.  In
comparison, the so called “pack ice ridges” are considerably thicker. To
investigate them more thoroughly various instruments have been installed in the
ice.

Christian Haas: We see here that some pack ice ridges are up to three metres
high. Pack ice ridges are like icebergs, that means that roughly a tenth of
appears above the surface and nine-tenth of them are under water. It follows
that where there are pack ice ridges the ice can be 10, 20 or even more metres
thick. We have observed this with our remotely controlled ROV, with which we
were able to make  sonar measurements of the ice depth and we have already
found ice thickness of over 10 metres. In our last big action, we installed a
number of instruments in some of these pack ice ridges. We call this the “Pack
Ice Ridge Observatory” and we want to use it to observe on the one hand how the
underside is eroded by currents and by the warmth that is present in the sea
water and on the other hand  how the pack ice ridges are frozen from above. In
addition, we want to know how, because of their rough surfaces, they are
affected by turbulence in both air and water and whether this is important for
their growth or melting.

Most ice measurements are made by drilling holes in the ice and then placing
instruments underneath the ice or in it. That’s exactly what we have to do
here. We have placed large measuring devices, that require large holes to be
drilled, at the periphery of the pack ice ridges and underneath the ice. These
are for instance instruments that measure water currents and turbulence.  Then
we embedded thermistor chains over the whole ridge as well as in the thickest
ice, that was more than 8 metres thick in places. With these chains we can
observe how the ridges cool, how they freeze in the centre, and how the
processes of erosion and disintegration  take place on their undersurface.

Commentator: Research in other scientific disciplines is also ongoing. A great
deal of weather data is being collected both on the Polarstern and  in the Ice
Camp. Still lower temperatures than the current low temperature of minus 35
degrees have been measured there and that has led to one or two expedition
members experiencing mild frostbite.

Christian Haas:  By itself the air temperatures aren’t sufficient to judge how
cold it really feels on the ice, because it’s the combination of air
temperature and wind strength, what’s called “windchill”, or in other words
perceived temperature,  that’s important. Unfortunately, some of the coldest
periods occurred at the same time as phases when the winds were strongest.
Windspeeds went up to 50 km per hour and the perceived temperature fell under
minus forty-five, sometimes under minus fifty. This made work on the ice very,
very  unpleasant and even almost dangerous. Although we have very good extreme
weather clothing, a few people still managed to experience mild frostbite on
their faces. This is very difficult to avoid when you are really concentrating
on your work and you forget how cold your cheeks, or your nose, is getting.

Commentator: The safety of the team is still first priority. In case there
should be a medical emergency, that luckily hasn’t happened yet and hopefully
won’t in the future, then expedition members can be airlifted out. 

Christian Haas:  We are approximately 300 kilometres from the North Pole and
therefore a long way from any form of human civilisation and from any form of
help that we would need if an accident were to occur. Basically, we are further
away from help and civilisation than one would be on the international space
station.  For this reason, we have made contingency plans for how we would
obtain help in case it was really needed. One of these plans is that we could
be reached by a light aircraft with skis that could land here and bring help or
airlift a sick person out.  However, such an aircraft would require that we
have a more or less even landing strip, which wouldn’t be there naturally,
because the ice needs to be thick enough - at least 50 centimetres – for the
aircraft to land safely. Because of this, during the last few days we
constructed a test landing strip close to the ship, so as to minimise our use
of  resources. To do this we used Pistenbullys, these are tractors equipped
with snow ploughs and rotary hoes [Ed. In English they are also known as
“Snowgroomers”]. This Pistenbully prepared a roughly 400-metre-long,
25-metre-wide  landing strip, that is very, very flat – so flat that even an
aircraft with landing wheels could land here. That was a very important
exercise for us to allow us to  prepare for the construction a larger landing
strip that we will need for the changeover between legs 3 and 4.

Commentator: The scheme for protection from Polar bears is also still active,
although so far during leg 2 no polar bears have seen. Instead the camp was
visited by other four-legged creatures who unfortunately caused minor problems
with various measurements.

Christian Haas: The pin up animal for the arctic is the polar bear and we are
prepared for them in all sorts of ways, although they aren’t as dangerous as
they are often made out to be. But, to our great disappointment, we haven’t yet
seen one. This isn’t perhaps so surprising, because in the middle of winter,
when its dark and the ocean is almost completely frozen over, there are neither
seals nor any other kind of food.  Then the polar bears tend to go South.
Therefore, given that our tour of duty was the mid-winter one, perhaps we
shouldn’t necessarily have expected to see many of them. But what then  did
surprise us, although there are past reports of it, is that we were visited by
Arctic foxes. Up to 6 of them were seen. They stayed in the neighbourhood of
the ship quite a long time, circling the ship and playing. That was something
of an occasion here and a bit of a diversion. Naturally, first of all we
thought that the foxes were cute animals and nice to look at. However, actually
they presented something of a danger to our measurements because they love
chewing cables. And accordingly, some of the foxes chewed through some of the
cables that we had laid across the ice to connect measuring instruments with
dataloggers, batteries or generators, interrupting measurements. But then we
were able to successfully protect the cables against the foxes and were able to
drive them away and for the last two weeks there haven’t been any more foxes
here and our work could continue unhindered.[Ed.: on the MOSAIC webpage on 6
January a further instance of damage was discovered and  reported and the
remark made that the foxes had been seen at “the end of December”] 

Commentator: Christian Haas is looking forward to the coming weeks and the
upcoming research work, although the conditions for it won’t be made easier by
the continuing polar night and the further decrease in temperatures. He is very
focussed on keeping the goal of the MOSAIC expedition in his sights.

Christian Haas:  We are still moving into February and March, that’s actually
the coldest season in the arctic. That means that weather conditions will
become even more extreme. Nonetheless, I believe we will continue to work
enthusiastically on the ice. Because now, just as we are slowly beginning to
get good time-series measurements of atmospheric conditions and of ice and
water conditions, the information is becoming increasingly interesting and we
are getting nearer to fulfilling the goal of the MOSAIC expedition to
investigate the interaction between the atmosphere, ocean and  ice and, and we
shouldn’t forget that, the Biology of the arctic. So I hope that we will
continue to be able to work unhindered. Naturally one or two ice deformation
events should also take place, if possible, at quite a distance from the  ship.
We will continue to expand the radius of the area that we move in. Apart from
that, I hope that we might indeed get a storm that will bring us some snow.
Till now the snow has been very sparse, the snow cover is between eight and
twenty centimetres. And what we also hope for, even if it may sound
paradoxical, is that at some stage we get an intrusion of warm air that will
temporarily give rise to very high temperatures and even to a little rain, as
has been seen with increasing frequency in past years and about which there has
been much speculation as to the effect it has on ice cover and ice growth. We
now have a unique opportunity to observe the phenomena on the spot and that is
absolutely necessary to better understand these processes.

Drift update, testing the brakes before a hairpin bend. :updated below
Added a close up from 27th onwards of the nearest Obuoy (to the north east)
which report location every 10 minutes. No drift speed but the ani has 6 frames
/hr (at 7fps)
O4 temp/salinity/pressure chart from meereis. That still doesn't make sense to
me, a sharp salinity increase but temperature goes down. (legend position is
unfortunate, see #521)
edit:Looking more carefully, the spike in salinity is at 20m. At 100m salinity
dips with the drop in temperature.

Nice interview, psymmo7. Haas is not correct about ten minute intervals between
bow radar scenes. For example, the Nov 11 has two scenes three minutes apart,
12:00 and 12:03.

This is important for determining operational safety. That is, can massive
rifts open in seconds or is the time scale minutes, hours or days, conveniently
preceded by ample warning noise? They have already had one scientist fall in up
to her waist, another to the top of his boot.

On leg 1, they ran out of connectors and could not replace critical cabling
buried under yet another overnight pressure ridge until the relief icebreaker
arrived. Some of the cracks grew very slowly and could be monitored for days,
like the one that eventually toppled and broke the Met tower.

FoMo posted a great graphic yesterday showing open water many meters wide
associated with an overnight 5 m pressure ridge that buried their snowmobile
track.

Looking through the totality of bow radar image pairs to date, the worst case
scenario was the Jan 26th pair 09:57/11:59 (see above mp4), with massive
km-scale leads and ridges forming within 2hrs 02min of separation. Quite a wide
area was affected over days so it wouldn't take bad luck to be in the wrong
spot at the wrong time.

In past years, we have seen cracks propagate from Banks Island to western
Siberia overnight, minimally 40 km/hr. The Norwegian airboat camps were hit
twice with serious loss of equipment.

    Added a close up from 27th onwards of the nearest Obuoy (to the north east)

Here is the mega track of buoy 201904 back to Day One. The display is generated
by the 16,142 points at 10-minute intervals. The attached kml file allows
unlimited zoom, rotation, and co-display with other types of tracks such as
S1AB availability, bow radar availability, wind direction from sailwx and so
on.

The Polarstern's track would be virtually indistinguishable at this scale, with
a constant offset from this buoy. The velocity of buoy 201904 is easily
computed within its csv and assigned a color palette, as is any scalar quanity
(such as salinity or temperature at a given depth) measured by the buoy.

The buoy overview graphic at Meereis Portal is done well; the palette allows
selection of individual buoy types and color changes. There do not appear to be
any 'snow buoys' or 'other' displayed. Again, this is best done in GoogEarthPro
with a folder containing a folder of each buoys class because this allows
disentangling the complexity via checkboxes and visitor download of the data
generating the image.

Winds are moderate but shifting around quite a bit, with temperatures up 12
degrees from the expedition low of -35º on 20-01-28 (which fortunately had only
3 m/s wind chill). It doesn't seem like barometric pressure has settled into
much of a winter pattern so far; this is resulting in a meagre Beaufort arm and
back-and-forth in the Fram export area.

All three Ascats are back after several days of shaky downloads to the base
stations. S1AB caught the ship on three recent days despite the extreme
latitude. Mosaic_multisensor was discontinued on Jan 21st; it needs
re-conceptualization.

Bow radar of the last 48 hours shows newly constituted ice plates settling back
down after extensive regional shearing earlier. This relaxation process has
repacked ice blocks more or less the way they were before. Floe boundaries
formed during fall freeze-up have seemingly lost relevance even though the
joints are commonly presumed weak and prone to fracture.

FoMo posted a very interesting photo on Jan 27th of a 5m high pressure debris
and extensive open lead. The jumble of ice obliterated an Ice Camp road
(snowmobile track). The lead has quite a bit of broken ice floating in the
water, frozen in like raisins in pudding by now with the temperatures in the
-30's.

What probably happened here is the lead opened and closed repeatedly, forcing
ice fragments onto one shore. This does not make a proper pressure ridge, no
keel. It is clear from the photo that snow accumulation has been minimal (below
a boot) and the ice has not thickened much at this site.

FoMo's most recent post shows leg 3 participants loading up for the
mid-February replacements and refurbishments. The relief icebreaker is not
likely the Kapitan Dranitsyn as stated. The KD is not a proper icebreaker to
begin with, cannot function in 3m waves when loaded with scientific containers.
It got stuck already leaving in December ice.

The KD has no prospects of reaching the Polarstern nor returning to port in the
thicker ice of mid-February. It's hugely expensive to be rescued by a
commercial nuclear icebreaker and can involve several weeks of waiting at sea
because of prior scheduling commitments. So this will be the Akademik Fedorov
doing the exchange.

The 3rd image shows the level of buoy track detail available in GEPro (compare
to #541 above). It is a fairly good match to the buoy's GPS accuracy at this
latitude.

The 4th animation takes Uniq’s buoy animation in #544, adds red dots to mark
each day at 06:00, cuts down to just one of the parallel buoy tracks, adds a
GFS wind track out 24 hours from the final frame, and uses that to
conceptualize where the buoy will be tomorrow (green line, red dots every 3
hours; scale is off). The buoy is an offset proxy for the Polarstern drift.

Maybe the AK or another icebreaker will escort the KD? Unbelievable, the KD had
to sit in a fjord for six days before the last trip, weather off Tromsø. Gear
on deck sliding back and forth.

Or maybe the KD can retrace its last route. We could follow it for weeks as a
white track. Not seeing it on the last 3 S1AB though.

Wow, look at the regional ice motion for the last three days. Orientation is
rotated 180º to match Mosaic practice. Not quite enough resolution to match bow
radar though 06:00 times are favorable.

Looks like we can patch the high resolution coordinate set between the buoys
and older mos_mult. Haas might be open to releasing ship bearing and GPS data
(?)

GFS is sticking to its story: a cyclone will graze the Polarstern tomorrow.
Where exactly is hard to say because intermediate drift affects the details of
the ship's position relative to cyclone structure. Scientifically speaking,
this is an incredible opportunity to see close-up how the ice pack responds to
a fast-moving circulating (and drifting) wind pattern.

The ice off the port bow remains restless but continues to settle in. Pressure
ridges and keels should be building as ice plates collide but that is not
immediately apparent in the two frames, The Polarstern passed through a blast
of warm air off the Barents; by the time the air completed the CCW cyclone
circuit, it was a whole lot colder. The pink lines from awiMet show conditions
at the times of the bow radar frames; the green pressure at 06:00 match the GFS
timestamp.

drift update, pretty much due east again after 2 hairpin bends. Here
introducing p193, making a grand entrance by obliterating the 87.4N label but
should improve efforts at estimating PS location. P201 can take a well earned
rest.
edit: updated to jan31 02:14, headed south temporarily.
edit2: T56 temperatures (every 6 hours) over the same time period (jan18-31),
confirming the FoMo temps below.

The nearest Obuoy, 2019O4, with surface temp measurements every 10mins must
have the sensor buried in snow/ice

    after 2 hairpin bends

The Polarstern enters the maelstrom later today; it may seriously contort
tracks of the buoy array that accompanies it by midnight UTC. The bottom
slideshow below scales the maximum view of GFS at Nullschool up 22.23x to match
the scale of Uniq's buoy tracks. They are positioned very differently with
respect to cyclone wind speed which increases drastically out radially (from 2
to 12 m/s). The position of the Polarstern is uncertain 12 hrs out, as is GFS.

Some km-scale shifts in the ice off the Polarstern's bow and port sides
accompanied the twenty hour episode of double digit winds on Jan 30th. The
white scale bar should be 250m not 25.

While waiting around for the KD to leave for leg 3, L Kaleschke made quite an
interesting whole-Arctic mp4 of leads from "AMSR" from Oct 1st to Jan 31,
archived as small individual grayscale tifs. The whole current set of 123 days
open up to a reasonable 78 MB. This is a very important addition to the overly
local (5 km) view of leads from the bridge radar.

Note this cannot be done from the AMSR2 png archive we use because in
mid-winter even the large format images are almost entirely pure white, 255
(100% SIC). There's no information about leads in a block of pure color.
Kaleschke's tifs use very light grayscale but only the pole hole is white.

The indexed coloring scheme resolution seems sub-optimal but alternatives are
easy with ImageJ. The Polarstern track could be added though it is tiny at this
scale; S1AB thumbnails and bow radar could be inset in wasted space. The leads
could be extracted and overlaid on Ascat with 'darken only'. For that, all the
leads, thick or thin, need to be pulled with 'threshold'.

    ImageJ

Sorry for OT, but... image processing in Java?  Does this thing really work?

It's been some time ago, when I had to program and/or use Java for graphics.
Some of the most ridiculous (incl. dangerous) bugs/algorithms I've ever seen.
Not to speak of the performance.

    image processing in Java?

Yes, ImageJ freeware was built by and for scientists doing advanced imaging
analysis in cell biology and astronomy. It is extremely stable and fast with a
large tool overlap with Photoshop and Gimp but many powerful ones of its own.
It has a common code base with great updating but grows by independent
contributed modules (.jars) that don't trip over each other as you add them.
Most of these are implemented algos from mathematics-based IP journals. It is
very convenient for complex manipulations of stacks (ie time series). One
weakness is very limited 'undo'; another is alpha channel masking.

C Katlein, the ROV operator on leg 2, has been posting interesting photos
almost every day (despite FoMo publicists repeatedly insisting the Polarstern's
100 mbps internet connection doesn't allow for this.) 

https://twitter.com/CKatlein

Other people are tweeting about bear visits; these have been far more frequent
than FoMo has acknowledged. These are not always seen by the bear guards; some
visits alongside the ship are inferred from tracks. Both polar bears and foxes
associate ships with food; people on the AF even fed them over the rails. 

The first image below shows the view from below: the ROV mapping the depths of
pressure ridge keels. Only the z axis is provided so the xy scale relative to
the Ice Camp and the five ridges being drilled isn't provided but probably is
500 m or so. Some of the keels go quite deep, perhaps 5 m; it's hard to say as
palette colors don't match depth colors.

The ROV is also pictured measuring an ablation stake sticking out the bottom of
the icepack. Ice, especially on keels, is lost frictionally from drift relative
to stationary ocean water; deeper keels melt because they're situated in water
above the freezing point. The sub-freeboard ice pictured is 0.9 m.

FoMo is reporting extreme bounces in ship weather today that are in mild
contradiction to the weather data they send out to awiMet, sailwx, DWD
(Germany's NWS), and ECMWF. This might result from using instantaneous data vs
hourly means or from stations at different heights above the ice.

Oddly, Mosaic does not seem aware of GFS nullschool providing frequently
re-initialized and so far quite accurate 3-hour views of wind direction and
strength forming the basin-wide cyclonic weather pattern, despite having a
full-time staffer on board from Deutscher Wetterdienst. All the comments to
date take a purely point perspective whereas a synoptic view is essential to
understanding where the warm and cold air are coming from, why the ice is
fracturing and where the Polarstern will drift next.

Attached also is an edited list of 56 recent papers by leg 2 leader C Haas. His
background is geophysics and main current interest observation-based sea ice
thickness. Free full texts are easily located online by searching on the full
titles; he also maintains a ResearchGate page. His most recent paper, moored
sonars in the Laptev, has just gone into review at open source/open review
Cryosphere Today (where he is an editor!).

Compare this statement from Haas to the data hoarding during leg 1:

Quote

    One of the objectives of the CryoVEx campaign was to observe how snow and
    sea-ice thickness varies along a CryoSat track from the coast of Canada
    across the multiyear ice zone into the first-year ice further north.

    A week after this part of the CryoVEx campaign was completed, data
    processing has progressed and we can present some first results. These will
    be invaluable for CryoSat and IceBridge data processing by the various
    groups, for assessment of the state of Arctic sea ice after an
    exceptionally warm winter, and for initializing predictions of summer ice
    conditions.

As a tightly wound cyclone drifted over the Polarstern this morning,
near-surface conditions went from 1 m/s under the eye to 16 m/s in single hour
accompanied by a 180º shift in wind direction, then reached an expedition peak
of sustained 19-20 m/s winds. (In other units, 20 m/s is 77 km/hr, 38.9 knots,
44.7 m/h).

Note the extraordinarily warm near-surface air temperatures in the early am:
-11.5ºC. GFS has this at 11.0ºC. FoMo goes on with crazy talk about this warmth
coming up from Svalbard despite the wind there blowing straight down the Fram.
FoMo ignores the storm raging outside to share more trivia on microscopic
plankton and cod minnows.

Better to have saved the life boat story for today? Some 90% of ship
emergencies are due to fires on board. The captain has discussed the many
preparations for that. Despite off-loading gear to the ice, many tons of
untested electrical devices from 19 countries remain aboard.

Should the ship list seriously to port because of impinging starboard pressure
ridge ice (on the Fram, these got higher than the mast), it won't be possible
to launch half the lifeboats using eight guys tugging on a rope around a
dislodged mooring I-beam. The other lifeboats might launch adrift in a
corresponding port lead and so be inaccessible. Would it make sense to store
some well-stocked lifeboats on the ice the whole time?

Without the Pistenbullys, an emergency airstrip could not be groomed. Indeed,
we've not seen the promised follow-up on the trial airstrip of Jan 8th. It must
have become totally inoperative within days from the daily ice pack grinding
seen on bow radar; it would take an amphibious 4WD ATV to go down the runway
now. This scenario could leave 150 people doubled up on half rations inside the
functioning lifeboats for a month or more.

    2020 AWI is recruiting 17 PhD candidates and 12 Postdocs to strengthen its
    new research program "Changing Earth – Sustaining our Future". Applications
    ar now open in the following research areas: atmosphere, ocean, ice and
    land; Arctic ecosystems and permafrost, marine and polar life marine
    bio-economy. Over €1 000 000 000 has been allocated to build Polarstern II.

How about €50/day to pay a science grad to oversee daily FoMo blurbing? Climate
change --> no fisheries bio-economy in the Arctic or anywhere else after the
ice melts, why throw resources at it.

The sharp curvature and high (and rapidly changing) gradient of the wind stress
field will couple strongly to edges of pressure ridge jumbles and giant sails
like the Polarstern side. The ship's orientation (bearing) is not disclosed so
we don't know when the winds hit broadside or astern; there's no S1AB coverage
today.

Pitch and roll are not disclosed either, though even the min-sub has a nice
heads-up display of them. We can see from swings in the bow radar contrast and
orientation that the ship is not really frozen-in but merely moored on the
starboard side.

This is by design as the hull must lift up (rather than collapse) if pressured
by ice on the side. The draft as currently loaded is ~4.0m so most of submerged
parts (eg keel and propeller) lie in water too warm too freeze. An early FoMo
photo out from the moon pool confirms this.

These high wind speeds will put record stress on the icepack. However today's
bow radar will only cover the fracturing until midnight of Jan 31st; the event
is continuing through 1500Z today. The drift is strongly to the Siberian south
and slightly west ('to the right' of GFS wind as Nansen noted).

In the awiMET table, when their one decimal latitude and longitude "hold
steady" despite sustained strong winds from 330º, that means the Polarstern is
rapidly moving due south towards the New Siberian Islands. This will eventually
show up as 87.3 latitude. (The Polarstern drifts about 7 km/day, 0.29 km/hr on
Uniq buoy scale, under local winds speed averaging 6 m/s or 22.6 km/hr.)

Only minor plate readjustments on the port side have occurred so far, raising
the question of time lag between applied stress and brittle failure. However a
4.2º CCW rotation of the bow took place in the 12 hours before midnight on Jan
31.

    Very nice amsr2 arctic lead product.

Very nice indeed! Kaleschke has been publishing on AMSR-E (passive 18.7, 89
GHz, since 2002) for 13 years including lead detection so this is not out of
the blue -- but what sudden inspiration struck him there on the wharf?
Hopefully updates will keep coming while at sea; posting time changes suggest a
pipeline is not yet fully set up.

This will get us into Hough transforms, a familiar technique from image
analysis used to detect sub-pixel geometric features such as linear leads.
ImageJ plugins are totally on top of this.

Hough was automating bubble chamber decay analysis in the 1950's. In math,
these have been known as 2D radon transforms from 1917 on. The inverse is used
in medical scans.

In the case of leads, a time-dependent 2D+T Hough transform might sharpen the
product. That is, OsiSaf describes basin-wide how ice is moving, meaning the
day n+1 AMSRE can be brought back to augment the search of leads on day n. (For
all we know, this could have been Kaleschke's processing breakthrough.)

Regionally, ice motion is available from consecutive S1AB pair overlaps which
generally exist for the Polarstern area. Locally, the buoy swarm gives ice
motion very accurately at 30 minute intervals; leads can be extracted from
dispersion in the delaunay diagram (the GPS is precise, ice does not stretch).
However the scale of buoy deployment is well below that of AMSRE.

Pressure ridges don't show up on that satellite but can be inferred to exist
when a lead closes, provided that can be distinguished from freezing over.
Tracking these features might identify multiple openings over time of the same
weakness.

The Feb 1st lead frame is below, slightly modified. Note how the view is cut
off well east of Banks Island and much of the Beaufort/Chukchi; the detectable
leads detected are almost entirely in MYI.

The base map is the same projection but different scale as forum AMRS2. However
that can provide convenient land and open water masks and a graticule at
124.98% enlargement. Note the pole hole is slightly larger in AMSRE-K but still
well inside 89º. Ascat then needs to be resized by 2.2827 * 1.2498 = 2.8592 to
take a dark or colored overlay from what we think is AMSRE-Kaleschke.

However even if the latter is cropped to the 'good stuff', it is still 770 pxls
wide, whereas the forum limit is 700 so the above enlargements need to be
dialed back by 10%. Assuming only MYI is left at the time of mooring on Oct
4th, it may make sense to use the AMSR2 open water to mask AMSRE-Kaleschke on
all the latter dates since the leads (and Polarstern) are in the MYI and drift
within the frame.

On the bright side, the 90º Eurasian quadrant of the Polarstern provides
350x350 pixels of AMSRE-K lead resolution, meaning it probably can withstand 2x
enlargement or double up as is with 3 other resources as a 700x700 (alt 4:3 or
16:9 aspect) mp4.

Care must be taken with repeatability of crop boundaries, enlargements and
contrast enhancements so that incoming Feb updates to the leads can be easily
concatenated onto the current product.

    Verify those leads!

It may not work that well to compare infrared (heat leaks) to radar (salinity,
SIC). Leads freeze over within hours at the prevailing winter temperatures;
that will affect the two images differently. The infrared image has much better
resolution during cloud-free days.

A lot can be done with this AMSRE time series from L Kaleschke, including
visualization of whole icepack drift about as well as Ascat. Both suffer
somewhat from incoming weather systems.

The major cyclone is affecting the ice around the Polarstern at quite a few
locations but so far not as severely as the Nov 19th storm. That didn't really
give rise to major chaos until the 22nd.

On the bow radar, the Polarstern at 118 m in length scales to just 12 pixels in
length. A few multiples of that radius would pick up most of the instrument
sites, the test runway, CTD and ROV  holes and other observation sites. The 3x
enlargement is about all the image quality allows after enhancement. Almost all
of the starboard side gets masked out in the archive for unknown reasons (the
radars can provide 360º coverage as seen in N-ICE2015 data).

A late S1AB surfaced for 06:02 on Jan 31st. The PS is at 87.4365 96.4841 on
that image; the floe is quite altered in appearance. Some rifts are nearby that
may have absorbed some of the wind stress.

The Polarstern (red asterisk) barely made it onto Sentinel coverage. The image
is rotated 180º from PolarView to correspond better with Mosaic orientation.
The blue arrow runs along the ship axis with starboard and port sides
indicated. The bow radar points along this axis but is imaged as vertical. An
extended rift (yellow arrows) possibly corresponds to a local shear line seen
active above. The exit track of the KD is still visible as a white streak.

The second image is a composite of two consecutive Sentinel orbital scenes
derived from the jp2 rather than the jpg. The blue ellipse shows a rift zone a
ways from the Polarstern. This rift is difficult to date because coverage by
Sentinel has been spotty with the ship dodging in and out of the pole hole in
recent weeks.

Another S1AB just surfaced, for 02 Feb 2020. A remarkable rotation and
translational drift of the Polarstern region took place during these 48 hours.

    arriving very close to last week's location

Very effective visually to have tracks speed up as the drift speeds up. The km/
hr scale has tripled to accommodate actual data (next post); scales are not the
same in different buoy animations. Km/hr is the appropriate unit here; it's
hard to picture a floe moving even one meter per second (SI extremism?). For
glaciers, m/d makes more sense (Jakobshavn got up to 51 m/d).

The question is, do the buoys show this behavior every year but we just don't
notice because their motion is commonly dumbed down to weekly resolution? I
would say no, the wind pattern has been very peculiar this year -- and that's
about to continue with strong poleward motion turning east.

Been there, done that, doing it again:

     87.4   93.9 20-02-02 21:00
  87.4   94.0 20-02-02 20:00

The lead openings and closings are very active on a day by day basis though not
much of that shows up on the Polarstern bow radar. The new scale bars are
multiples of the 118m ship's length as almost all activity is nearby.

The Polarstern was in range this morning for a 06:00 Sentinel at 87.4 93.2.
PolarView is just now back from its near-daily breakdown; nothing north of 86.9
is showing.

I don't think that there are many previous buoys to compare to in this area.
Perhaps someone will search a couple out. Drift may appear faster when hourly
reports are missing, for example on jan31

Here showing most mosaic iabp buoys that report on the hour from sep29 to feb2.
R was used to calculate utm lat and lon and the graticule as in the drift
animations. The data was then run in octave to present the delaunay
triangulation. A small mismatch in image size required rescaling of the 
graticule so this is best efforts and should be seen as a guide only.
edit: The longitude labels are incorrect, they should be one place to the left.
135E is vertical.

    Drift may appear faster when hourly reports are missing

Slower? If the drift is A --> B  --> C  and the hourly is missing for position
B, then the A --> C speed will be slower to the extent ABC are not co-linear
(triangle inequality).

FoMo gave a dramatic example of this on Jan 14th (while omitting the key
parameter, sampling interval). At a buoy track crossing, the difference in
position (distance covered) is zero as is the speed but not the elapsed time.

The triangle inequality also holds on the surface of a sphere (or any
Riemannian manifold) but lines have to be geodesics. The buoys are not
constrained to move on geodesics (which become complicated in a hurry on the
WGS ellipsoid).

Distances between two lat lon points are typically approximated with the
sphere's haversine even if that geodesic doesn't follow along the actual buoy
track. When the points are close (ten minute sample times, slow speeds, no
jogs), the difference is utterly negligible and in fact ordinary lines on the
euclidean tangent plane suffice.

The issue here is not the ice speed per se but how it got there, what keeps it
there and what alters direction. In a situation like the central Arctic with
negligible near-surface currents and tidal influences, this is mainly wind
pushing on ridges but retarded by keels and drag with sea water.

Because of friction, there's no conservation of momentum: a floe in motion
doesn't stay in motion. Kinetic energy is quickly being dissipated as
(unnoticeable) heat.

Is there is such a thing as terminal velocity for ice (as for skydivers) and
have we approached it during the Mosaic expedition. Yes, wind can't keep up
with subsurface drag which goes up like the cube. No, because the 10-12 storms
expected haven't happened; extreme winds so far have been south of Svalbard and
east in the Barents.

    art of moving without moving

Art of back and forth on Feb 4th: The three bow radar scenes are best processed
individually because of contrast variability extremes within the master frames.
They are all from the same date, Feb 3rd. Some of the leads, shears and ridging
may extend into the Mosaic ice camp experimental areas or impinge on the
planned port side airstrip.

The new archive of Arctic-wide leads extracted daily from AMSR-E by L Kaleschke
are shown with exaggerated contrast under land and graticule masks from AMSR2.
The red star at 87.5 95.0 shows the approximate position of the Polarstern.

It is not currently possible to definitively relate new leads seen on the
basin-wide scale with much smaller features that can be seen at bow radar
resolution.

T Lavergne's OsiSaf shows ice motion at a similar scale as AMSR-E. The two
aren't readily compared because OsiSaf needs two days of data to get one
picture of motion; further the data is gridded meaning the features used in AI
are not retained or displayed.

T Krumpen is on different legs of the Polarstern (1a AF + leg 4 vs leg 3) than
Kaleschke but both work at AWI so it reasonable to expect sea ice motion
products to be improved soon. (Not in summer though.)

No S1AB today. The Polarstern will soon be in its pole hole again (but not that
of AMSRE leads), followed by a full day of Fram-ward drift, followed by
becalmed. What might be called aTPD (accidental Transpolar Drift).

I wonder if the Polarstern could be crushed if it gets close to Fram before
Summer, as ice streamlines converge laterally as the ice accelerates (in the
average motion), it is like people wanting to pass a small door in a panic
situation. Would that be a real concern or the boat  should resist?

The Polarstern has been on the job for 39 years. Its hull is designed to lift
up when experiencing compressive forces from the sides. It's not clear what
happens if the ship is torqued by forces at shearing angles. It has strain
gauges welded on the lower hull but when frozen in, options are limited. Would
the ship roll on its side or suffer structural damage?

In olden days, ships had  stout oak beams running abeam, seemingly crushproof.
That design didn't end well for the Jeanette: 

On 7 Sep 1879, the ship became frozen in the ice at 71°N 175°E. For the next 21
months, Jeannette drifted in an erratic fashion, frequently doubling back on
herself. On 12 June of 1881, the pressure of the ice crushed the Jeannette. De
Long and his men unloaded provisions onto the ice and watched as the ship sank
at 77°N 155°E [well south and east of the Polarstern).

Wreckage eventually came ashore on the central east coast of Greenland where it
was discovered by Nansen on a field trip there. This inspired his theory idea
of Transpolar Drift. It is evidence, along with carbon-dated beached logs at
Morris Jesup, that the TPD (and Fram export) have been operative a very long
time, even when the ice was much thicker and extensive than today.

Note the distinction: Transpolar Drift refers to surface ice blown by the wind;
Fram export is return flow of Atlantic Water inflows that are ~300 m below the
surface. The two often work together at the intake funnel of the Fram Strait at
~82º (East Greenland Current). Mosaic is tracking this double-diffusing
Atlantic Water and its turbulent eddies at depth for the entire expedition.

However it's not immediately apparent from the buoy array tracks that the cw
TPD -- which is air pressure pattern-dependent and ultimately driven by ccw
earth rotation -- is operative this year.

The Beaufort Gyre, the other textbook staple, is still going around and around
in the minds of True Believers despite irrefutable satellite evidence to the
contrary. A Beaufort arm of floes derived from MYI ice off the CAA reaches up
the AK coast to the Chukchi in most years but never completes a gyre. Today
Beaufort winds are circulating in a nice gyre but in the wrong direction!

Here are 127 days of Ascat and AMSRE leads from Oct 1st to today. The
Polarstern is currently about a third of the way from the pole to Severnaya
Zemlya (87.5 95.0 20-02-05 09:00). It is feasible to overlay the leads and
still see how the MYI ice on Ascat is drifting. Note the multiple origins of
ice exiting the Fram.

The overlay of sea ice concentration derived leads on cry2smos derived
thickness works well though thickness doesn't change much over the mid-Oct
early-Feb time span. (Note only 103 days are available compared to 127 for
Ascat and SIC leads because of a delayed start to cry2smos and delayed
archiving necessity.) This new product AMSRE lead archive from L Kaleschke has
enabled some important new visualizations.

No action today on the bow radar and none expected for the next few days as the
ship drifts farther north and then east. The Polarstern will be within the pole
hole of S1AB so no images will be available.

It would be instructive to make a one-day three-way comparison of infrared (#
557 250m VIIRS brightness temperature, band I5 night), SIC leads and S1B. It is
a little trickier to synchronize an overlay 24-hour leads on GFS nullschool
winds which is 3-hour without file size getting out of hand.

Will look at that if they don't come back tomorrow. Different format so would

    not a bad route.

The temptation is to sneak along the lee polynya north of FJI. However the
Kapitan isn't going to do that as it could easily slam shut, pushing the ship
onto the rocks as the wind changes over to forming a lee polynya on the other
side or below.

I don't expect the Barents to freeze over: too warm, too shallow, too windy,
too mixed, too unstratified, too much Atlantic Water coming in below Bear
Island. Every year people get fooled into thinking new ice is forming when the
satellite mp4 show the wind has merely blown the ice pack through the island
gaps. Again. St Anna trough is more nuanced.

The slide show below shows a couple of ways using Uniq's triple of buoys for
patching the database of 196 S1AB images for an additional 34 missing
Polarstern locations, a situation that has gotten much worse with the ship in
the pole hole.

Basically, the close-in buoys move in parallel curved tracks, more or less
keeping their distance and defining a stable triangle. Adding in a known high
precision of a nearby date with PS location establishes a fiducial
quadrilateral that can be moved and re-located at three buoy points on a frame
timestamps that lack a PS location. The lat lon can then be read from the
graticule or pixel coordinates.

Mosaic_mult has quit; they were privy to the ship's precision GPS and plotted
it even when the Polarstern was off the latest S1AB. Since their images came
with high resolution graticules, the earlier lat lon could be read off that (or
interpolated from flanking locations on slow dates).

Once a complete set of once-a-day 06:00 locations are known, the track can be
drawn in GoogEarth with pop-up links at each point along the path to the radar
image, GFS nullschool of that hour, local buoy radar of ice motion, and global
AMSRE leads.

Update 1: added a png showing how Polarstern lat lon can be measured directly
off S1AB radar scenes: (1) find the ship which is a bright radar reflector with
a stable pattern of floes around it, (2) zoom in 1600% with the BAS IWS viewer
provided at PolarView, (3) capture the lat lon at the middle of the ship, (4)
transcribe the data (5) check to see if consistent with approximate lat lon at
sailwx and MET, (6) check on PolarView jpg graticule, (7) repeat on a later
date for reproducibility.

Each of the steps can go wrong! Rechecking everything for the date with the
biggest longitude anomaly at Reply #427 for 27 Jan 2020 shows the S1AB method
seems to have produced an accurate reading of the PS location.

Update 2: added a distance scale to the graticule. Here a 0.1º difference in
latitude corresponds to 11.1 km and a 1.0º difference in longitude amounts (at
87.5º latitude) to 4.85 km. These are the dimensions of full graticule grid
cells. The buoy graticule may need adjustment;it is added manually after the
tracks are calculated.

Here buoys and Polarstern are being plotted to a tenth (1110m x 485) or maybe
even a hundredth of a grid cell 110m x 49m). With FoMo reporting a 1000m shear
off the port side disrupting the ROV site and bow radar showing multi-km
disruptions almost every day, the scale of ice motion distinct from joint
passive drift is commensurate with these sub-grid scales.

Note too that GPS readings at extreme latitudes can be disrupted by solar
flare, meaning a perfectly functioning buoy GPS will not really be reporting to
the accuracy of what it says on the box.

All this means buoy and Polarstern locations need to be taken with a grain of
salt. Accuracy depends on the precise timing with respect to leads opening and
closing and shearing forward and back.

Gulp. Those calculations would be great if my labelling was correct. p193 ends
at  87.5737,96.4523 on the last ani. I've corrected the labelling which is
still done manually.

    how are lat lon of Polarstern calculated from buoys and/or S1AB?

See update in #575. Buoy and ship positions dependnot only on ice pack drift
but also on the timing of position reports relative to shears and other
displacements which are of comparable scale.

The latest bow radar is showing significant ice pack motion at numerous sites
within its viewing window that presumably are representative of a much broader
area including the Mosaic experimental sites and beyond.

The 6-hour bow radar imagery is shown together with 6-hour GFS winds but
understanding causation requires looking at large-scale two day ice movement on
the Siberian side induced by the stationary anti-cyclone between Wrangel and
NSI, as displayed well by the ANSRE leads resource.

The Polarstern's floe is being squeezed between two shear plates, the ice
accommodates the stress on it by over-rafting into pressure ridges and keels.
Analysis continued in #581...

Curious that, although there is no trail of buoy locations, the lat-long grid
is erased by the progression of buoy location lat-longs.  Therefore, you can
'sort of' see where the buoys have been earlier in the GIF. (If not one sort of
memory, then another!)

    the lat-long grid is erased by the progression of buoy location

macid's original code uses R gganimate to create the animations. Adding the
graticule from plotSvalbard slows down the process by 5-6 times, making a 5m
job take 30mins. So I use a tip from A-Team to create the graticule with a
2frame animation, which takes a minute, clean up a couple of buoy dots, delete
the second frame and insert it into the long animation at frame2.
Add an alpha channel to the frame, set white to transparent and merge it down
to the first frame.
Much quicker, but the buoy paths overwrite the grat as they go along.
It's eco, saving the planet by using less processing power lol

Had a look for KD on S1B but all I could find was this. Looks more like a
plane. cffr

The circle, arrow and text overlay tools are confusing in ImageJ. Set the
palette color, draw the overlay on the ROI, then Edit --> Draw to flatten your
overlays into the base image. Otherwise the overlay will disappear with no
undo! Maybe try RAMMB to locate the KD, rotate that by 105º CW and rescale to
overlay on the jp2 version of PolarView which has mouse-over lat lon.

The prospects for the KD not being able to reach the Polarstern at all or
getting permanently stuck on the return trip (with all the leg2 scientists
aboard) are a definite concern.

Continuing the analysis from #578, the Polarstern's floe is being squeezed
between two shear plates that hit at oblique angles with a delay of six hours
or less, first from the left (port bow) and then from the right (port quarter).
This is one of the few sequences where the coupling between events can be seen
cascading throughout the bow radar view as the ice accommodates the squeeze by
over-rafting into pressure ridges and keels. The mp4 is rotated 90º CW; the b/w
scale bar is in multiples of the 118m ship length. The Polarstern's bow is at
the b/w hemispheres, the stern is at the end of the first black bar.

The Ascat pair supplements the AMSRE leads pair above but shows the active and
inactive zones more clearly in the two difference frames. The GFS anti-cyclone
is above the active zone; the thick and resistant central MYI is more or less
immobile. The Polarstern was on the boundary between the two zones.

Band 15 etc at WorldView are partly obscured by clouds and has confusing radial
swathing so an ice motion pair there is not feasible.

The gangplank and Ice Camp area are abaft the starboard beam...

Some points from the recent Arctic Drift Podcast:

The temperatures are low at the moment. Christain Haas talks about that there
is less snow cover as expected (half the average) which allows the ice to grow
in thickness due to the lack of insulation. Even though the wind wasn't too
strong, vast parts of the ice are without snow, high snow dunes on other parts.

Then he talks about the pressure rig observatory. They found algae and fishes
with the ROV in cavities.

He mentions the rifts that opened in the vicinity which they are using now to
do thermal and chemical measurements and observe how new ice develops.

They found out from ice core measurements that there were sediments in the floe
which allows them to make assumptions about its origin. It appears it is from a
shallow Siberian shelf.

The helicopter flights seem less of a hassle as it was expected. Haas seems
happy everything is working so well with them. Of course, this is important to
maintain, clean and activate the equipment, change batteries, etc.

A rotating laser scanner is giving them ice-roughness maps. They categorize ice
types this way and use this data for the still to build runway.

The crew change that will replace Lag 3 will be via airplane. They need a 1500m
runway with at least 1m ice thickness so plains with weels can land. The
development of pressure rigs and rifts has rendered some potential areas
useless as a runway.

    82.25N 68.77E, barely visible on the jpg
    not sure how long this link to the jp2 viewer will last.

A lat lon time for KD on sailwx or cruise locators to remove white dot
ambiguity and identify interlopers? Not seeing a swath, maybe seals up too fast
or takes thicker ice or they've been in a lead.

Links last many months, unlike at the PolarView portal which only stores the
jpg for 30 days. The url preserves the all-important auto-generated
hexadecimal, here 46F8_N_1, which is essential to finding the big package on
the awkward Copernicus Sentinel portal. The bslmagb.nerc-bas.ac.uk/iwsviewer/
is a huge breakthrough for the end user.

I've safely archived all the jpgs and lossy jp2 links containing the Polarstern
back to Oct 4th mooring. The attached cvs contains direct viewer links to all
the jp2 scenes as well as to GFS weather of their date and hour.

Below all 373 scenes to date of Polarstern bow radar are collected in two mp4.
The second of these (3x) examines the history of the peculiar area just in
front of the bow that has seen bad shearing but has since been stable for
months. These are uniformly brightened and sharpened with mild local contrast
(CLAHE 63 1.75 in the montage).

KD is making good progress two hours later. It measures ice thickness, not by
the silly system of people comparing a painted yardstick to overturned ice but
by a EM induction instrument projected from the bow.

This totals thousands of km of swath data by now that would have helped in
comparing various observational and model approaches to this key parameter.
However the thickness will not be divulged until 2023 when no one will have the
slightest interest. [We call this 'dog in the manger' science after an Aesop
fable.]

The KD is in a dense coverage area of S1AB; however we won't see the PS and KD
join up because the PS is going ever deeper in the pole hole this week to
88.0º.  We can expect the KD to use its previous track coming in so as not to
create yet another damaging swath near the study area.

Quote

    At the three L-sites within the MOSAiC Distributed Network (~15 km distant
    from Polarstern at the beginning), the project will install Atmospheric
    Surface Flux Stations (ASFS) that include measurements at 0-3m height of
    pressure, temperature, relative humidity, high-frequency three-dimensional
    winds, high-frequency water vapor and carbon dioxide concentrations,
    surface height (snow depth), surface infrared temperature, surface heat
    flux, and up- and down-welling longwave and shortwave radiation.

    Adjacent to these atmospheric surface flux measurements at each of the four
    locations will be an ice mass balance buoy for measuring ice thickness and
    thermodynamic structure, and an Autonomous Ocean Flux Buoy for measuring
    ocean fluxes of heat, momentum, and salt. Jointly these measurements allow
    for a full documentation of the thermodynamic state of the sea ice.

    Additionally, an array of GPS position buoys will be installed across the
    full MOSAiC Distributed Network to provide detailed information on ice
    dynamics.

    https://epic.awi.de/id/eprint/50082/1/Expeditionsprogramm_PS122_leg2.pdf 
    page 36

The Polarstern lost an important piece of remotely deployed atmospheric flux
equipment yesterday; unfortunately the Kapitan Dranitsyn is not bringing a
replacement as it had already left before the pressure ridge occurred. Mosaic
did not share the previous loss of function of this device, its earlier
repairs, nor even its approximate current location.

This used up quite a bit of helicopter fuel; the KD will be bringing more.
However between legs 3/4, only planes can reach the PS. The 1500m runway is
very much in doubt currently due to constant development of pressure ridges,
leads and offset shears. Planes are primarily for staff exchange; they cannot
bring in fuel.

This hole by the gangplank ... what were they thinking? It freezes over from
cold ice on the sides (so use 4x8 marine plywood insulated with foam) and from
the cold air (use 8" foam board cover, not a complex flimsy tent that cannot be
set up in wind). Any lumber yard in the US would have these. Immersion heaters?
-- the hole is not even hot tub-sized and just a few meters from ship power
supply. $29.95 per 3000W @ ebay.

We have seen so many times that gear testing back home (Bay of Bothnia?
ice-fishing in Minnesota?) would have greatly reduced data downtime at Arctic
drift sites. No record of downtime has been disclosed and never will be.

    still headed north and west, picking up speed

This Polarstern drift will continue strongly in this direction for several more
days due to a persistent anti-cyclone to the north of Wrangel Island. Tailwinds
will reach 10-12 m/s which are sub-gale strength.

The ship was at lat lon 87.8 91.7 at 1200Z today and will reach 88.1 86 later
in the week, putting them in peak transpolar drift position. The concern has
gone from them milling about for months in the Central Arctic to reaching the
Fram four months ahead of schedule.

Fram export has really picked up under these wind conditions though it has been
steady since mooring. It's very unusual to see the Fram  'intake funnel' of
curved concentric leads extend up and past the north pole. This development
will become even more extreme this week; the significance is the last of the
very oldest and thickest MYI is being drawn down towards export.

The Fram situation seems completely uncoupled to the Nares-Banks Island ice
above the CAA. Nares export has ceased for the time being.

An unusual collision of a very large ice plate with the Mosaic floe happened
yesterday a couple of km off the bow over just six hours. A small pressure
ridge much closer to the Polarstern has also developed off the port bow in the
vicinity of the proposed airstrip.

If L Kaleschke is able to add a few earlier years to the lead visualization
archive, it might be possible to test the proposition that ice motion has
really gotten worse this year. These leads add a large number of trackable
features allowing much higher resolution to description of motion.

This seal is a very long ways from the nearest open water. No photo of it on
FoMo today. Seals don't just dive and take their chances on finding the next
open lead when they need to breathe -- so presumably a maintained breathing
hole is near the Polarstern. Ringed seals will also use cracks and gaps in the
ice cover (such as tracks from relief icebreakers?).

Ringed seals have 2.5 cm long claws on their fore-flippers and can dig holes
through 2m ice. The ice at the ROV hole is just over a meter thick; maybe the
seal will do a better job of keeping it open.

But how can they catch fish underwater in mid-winter when it is dark already on
the ice surface  and much darker below? They hunt under the ice for schooling
fishes (particularly polar cod) and pelagic invertebrates but possibly also
copepods etc living on the underside of the ice probably using whiskers.

    Six seal species live in the Arctic: harp, hooded, spotted, ribbon, ringed,
    bearded. The latter two use breathing holes in the ice. Most of the ringed
    seals' time is spent near shore ice, but their ability to maintain
    cone-shaped breathing holes—which the animals excavate in the ice using the
    claws of their front flippers—allows them to occupy areas much farther from
    the ice edge than other seals can reach. Physiological adaptations help
    them make deep, sustained dives, reaching depths of 300 feet and remaining
    submerged for up to 45 minutes. But before surfacing, they sometimes blow
    bubbles up their breathing hole to check for polar bears, their main
    predator.

    When he realized, that he won't drift to the pole, #Nansen went North by
    skis. As we likely passed our northernmost point, we did the same ... As
    we are already 150km further north than he ever reached, we only walked
    for 1 hour and camped only 1 night to test our survival

Maybe they'll go camping again  https://twitter.com/CKatlein

tech note: nullschool locations are from p207, the northernmost buoy. The title
is incorrect. It should say P201, 204 and 207. P193 often, but irregularly,
misses ~2hrs of data so I went back to 201.

    PS flew west & north yesterday 

Another 48 hours of that coming. The Polarstern reached new lat and lon records
of 87.8 89.2 at 19:00Z which is 245 km from the pole and 919 km from the
entrance to the Fram Strait. The weather pattern is pushing the whole Euro side
of the icepack in that same direction.

That is shown in a 62-day Ascat below. The darker areas are thick MYI ice;
significant pieces of it (though not the Lincoln Sea and west) will
irreversibly enter the export staging area if the GFS winds keep up as
expected. Not unrelated: the Arctic Oscillation index just hit a new high.

The bow radar we've been looking at is a ~10.0ghz product called a sigma S6 Ice
Navigator system made by Rutter Inc of St Johns NL (https://rutter.ca/
ice-navigation/). It's also been installed on the Healy and RV Lance.

The radar is operated by bridge command only and never before have scientists
requested it for Polarstern research. The 1.5m wide X-band antenna is mounted
on starboard side of platform B in crow's nest.

https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016JC012387

It does not seem to have been configured properly (to compensate for motion
using feedback from gyros) resulting in images not nearly as sharp as they
could be. The whole control panel has been cropped out in the meereis archive.

The basic purpose when the Polarstern is underway is distinguishing between
open water, ice pans, open water leads in ice fields and ice ridges that can
trap icebreakers. In open water the ice radar detects small bergy bits and
growlers (large and small glacier calving pieces) that can significantly damage
a vessel.

That is a surprisingly large westward component. And increasing, despite a
steady wind bearing. Seems like is it 'should' have been more northerly with
less of an eastward component.

If "North" is to the lower left of the GIF, aren't the buoys drifting northeast
ward?

Also, I'm confused with A-Team's "... surprisingly large westward component
..." and "... less of an eastward component."  [The "eastward component" is
what I see in Uniquorn's GIF.]

I'll be glad to be straightened out!

    Polar coord directions are confusing! Winds from the south? Not terribly
    descriptive at Pole. Being straightened out on the earth ellipsoid would be
    quite uncomfortable.

One way to remember is the "Far East" (in the eurocentric view) is Asia.
Western Europe is west of that though east of the US East Coast which is west
of the UK.

It all revolves around the Greenwich meridian. That runs through the center of
the Fram Strait west of Svalbard. Going CCW from there is east; CW is west. The
Polarstern is steadily losing east longitude (0.1º per hour) because it is
going west towards the 0º meridian. Our maps use 'Greenland down' which is 45º
west rather than a 0º vertical.

The leg 1 Polarstern staff voted to have all their maps point north. Maybe we
could vote, though the world would take little note, to make east west and west
east and move the 0º meridian to Greenland? How would that work for the South
Pole? Let's not go there.

The mp4 follows ultra-local bow ice motion during the time the Polarstern has
been under steady tail winds straight from 110º (time frame of Uniq's #596).
These winds will perhaps continue another 81 hours to 02/15/0000Z (it's
20-02-12 15:00 now).

The question is, where will the PS track be by then? 88.05 79ºE. Will there be
extreme motion in the bow radar and if so, why then and not the last two days?

    Obviously I was turned upside down, and maybe backwards, too. :o


Unicorn's GIF shows the trace of buoys moving over a period of time, with a
'running commentary' of the 'current' location's Lat-Long.  The lines of
longitude get closer in the lower left corner, so "North" is in that
direction.  From the perspective of (or watching from) the North Pole,
something traveling eastward will be going from right to left, England to
Russia, and westward will be going left to right, Russia towards England. 
Traveling westward on the Eurasia side of the Earth the ("E") longitude numbers
go down.

Clearly the buoys are going left to right so they are going westward, and as
the longitudinal number are going down, the Kara Sea is off to the upper right
of the map.  We can also determine that the latitude parallels are at 0.1º
intervals and the longitudinal lines are at 1.0º intervals in this
presentation.][/li]
[/list]

Got it (for now). [And no wonder my tectonics professor once claimed I must be
a member of Flat Earth Society!]

Here is an English transcript of the latest podcast from the MOSAIC website
that is otherwise only available in German.
MOSAIC_AUDIOLOG BOOK12

 
Posted last Sunday (February 9. 2020) at 9:02 AM

Installment 12 – little snow, lots of new findings & “Gurki”

In this installment expedition leader Christian Haas reports lots of new
findings that have been gathered in various scientific areas of the  MOSAIC
expedition. One finding among them concerns the  formation and original
provenance of the various ice types. In addition, during the last few days,
various living organisms have been found in the ice. Haas describes the current
status of the programme for  building a landing strip and gives an insight into
various  kinds of methods and  measurement techniques.

Commentator: Arctic Drift – the Audio Logbook.

Christian Haas: Today is one of the coldest days that we have experienced till
now, about minus 34 degrees. But luckily the wind is not particularly strong,
only about force 3, so that the wind chill temperature is only about minus 45
degrees.
 
Commentator: Very low temperatures continue to prevail in the Arctic. Despite
this the researchers on the MOSAIC expedition observe similar climate
alterations to those that are currently occurring in Europe. There is also
comparatively little snow in the Arctic. The expedition leader Christian Haas
explains why this change has consequences for the ice and why the researchers
welcome any change in the condition of the snow.

Christian Haas: During the last few days we even had Strong Wind event, with
force 5 to force 6 winds. That isn’t exactly a storm but, of course, given the
temperatures that we have here, it felt very, very cold. What was fantastic
about it, was that the snow was redistributed: that means that it was blown
away from some places and piled up in other places in deep drifts. These drifts
were several decimeters deep and several meters wide and long. As a result, the
landscape quite clearly changed in the course of the last few days. However,
just as before, there is still very little snow: on average between 9 and 12
centimetres, which is really a lot less, about half the amount that we would
expect from long term climate records. That leads to the ice being able to grow
thicker than it would be able to if the snow was deeper. This follows from the
fact that snow has very good insulating qualities and very low heat
conductance. Therefore a thin snow covering has the effect that the ice can
lose more heat and can grow faster as a result. If the snow were deeper, the
ice would grow significantly more slowly.

Commentator: In the previous installment Christian Haas already told us at some
length about the various kinds of instruments that were being placed in the
pressure ridges. The first measurements and observations from the so-called
Pressure Ridge Observatory are bringing results.

Christian Haas: Yes, a few weeks ago we set up the Pressure Ridge Observatory.
That meant that we installed a large number of measuring instruments in a large
pressure ridge to observe how the ice grows in  the cavities and under the
thickest ice and how the pressure ridges affect turbulence under the ice.
Currently we are making the first investigations with our ROV, our
remote-controlled unmanned submarine that is equipped  with cameras and is able
to take samples. And, just as we hoped,  we found fish, even now in winter, in
the cavities - the openings in the ice keels that occur in the pressure ridges
between the ice blocks. Small codfish that spend the winter hiding there. We
also found the remains of algal mats that will start to grow as soon as the
light returns and will serve as a food source for these fish.

Commentator: Intensive research is also going on in other scientific  fields.
As the result of new ice movement and a split in the ice inside the camp new
insights could be gained into ice formation.

Christian Haas: During the last few days we had a lead opening event and a
strong ice deformation event even though the wind wasn’t particularly strong.
However, because the ice is drifting continuously  there are always  local
differences in drift speed and drift direction. That happened now in our
vicinity about 2 kilometres south of the ship where a lead opened and an open
water surface about 20 metres wide and several hundred metres long was exposed
in a relatively short period of time. This event was very welcome, because it
enabled us to investigate the processes that occur when water is exposed in
this way, how quickly it loses heat and how ice forms on it  and how thick it
gets. So, several teams rolled out on the day it occurred and set up their
instruments around the lead and made measurements for hours and in some cases
days. They measured the water vapour above the  lead and how this affected the
warming of the air. They also measured how new ice came into being in the form
of  so-called frost flowers and the chemical processes that accompany it.

Commentator: In addition, the results of the ice-core-drilling programme  have
provided information about the place where the ice floe originally came from.

Christian Haas: Once a week we have an extensive ice core drilling programme
where we drill ice cores from different types of ice to examine their chemical
and biological properties. This week for the first time we found a core that
was full of sediment from the sea floor. At the moment we have 4000 metres of
ocean beneath us, so it’s a fairly natural question to ask how the sediment got
into the ice. But this sediment is a clear indication, if not proof, that that
our ice floe was formed in the very shallow water of the Siberian Shelf. The
water there is only 20 metres deep and if the wind is strong while the ice is
being formed sediment can get trapped in the ice. The sediment then drifts with
the ice and we can use it as a reliable tracer for identifying the origin of
our  floe.

Commentator:  Research doesn’t only take place on the ice.  Airborne  missions
with helicopters help the crew work more effectively by allowing regular
maintenance of automatic monitoring stations that are several kilometres
distant from the ship.

Christian Haas: One aspect of our activities here that’s very successful,
although we haven’t said much about it yet, is helicopter flights. It wasn’t
clear how well it would be possible to fly in the dark. Flying in darkness is
very challenging. We took a lot of effort to prepare the helicopters for it by
providing them with the right equipment for night flying. The pilots and
mechanics also had to undergo special training in order to be able to undertake
night flights here.  Fortunately, the effort has paid off. Because we have had
really very good weather conditions, we have been able to carry out a large
number of flights. We not  only made survey flights with the laser scanner in
the neighbourhood of the ship, but we also have a network of automatic
monitoring stations in an area between 10 and 50 kilometres from the ship and
we have been able to visit some of these locations and in some cases to land
there. We installed lights on them that can switched on by remote control, to
save battery power, and in this way we were able to visit them and carry out
maintenance tasks such as cleaning them, replacing batteries or reactivating
them. 

Christian Haas: Another important aspect of the helicopter flights is that we
carry out measurements of the thickness and  surface roughness of the ice. We
do that with a laser scanner that measures the height of the helicopter over
the ice with a rotating laser beam so that we cover a roughly 300 metre wide
track along the flight path. By flying criss-cross over the ice in a grid
pattern we can use this track to map large areas and can get a good impression
of the type of ice  and its surface properties.  The maps that we produce in
this way are our most important tools for being able to navigate through the
ice, because otherwise we have neither photographs nor high resolution
satellite data. An important feature of these freeboard and roughness maps is
that we have used them to identify possible locations for siting the landing
strip that we are going to construct during the next few weeks.

We need this airstrip for the crew exchange between the third and fourth legs
of the expedition, because we can only accomplish this  using larger aircraft
that land on wheels.   

The  landing strip will have to be one and a half kilometres long and on ice
that that is one metre thick. We have already begun to look for such possible
sites and the laser scanner maps were an important tool for doing this, because
we could distinguish between areas that were relatively flat and those that
were uneven because of pressure ridges. Of course we like to construct the
landing strip on a relatively flat area, because it would be very laborious to
have to try and remove and flatten humps and pressure ridges with the Pisten
Bullys. Unfortunately the recent deformation- and lead-opening- events have
destroyed some of the potential sites so that we must now wait until the
situation has stabilized and then make new survey flights to confirm whether
the sites we identified earlier are still suitable before we can begin with the
construction of the landing strip.

Commentator:  The laser data and the survey flights aren’t just important for
the construction of the airstrip and the maintenance of the automatic
monitoring stations. The movement of the ice can also be followed and analyzed
using aerial data. 

Christian Haas: At the moment the  laser scanner data are the most important
way for us to be able to observe the movement and deformation of the ice. For
instance, to see exactly where leads open, where pressure ridges occur and
where floes are colliding.  . During the lead-opening event that we already
mentioned we were successfully able to survey the area with the laser scanner
for several days and to follow how the ice opened up in some  places but was
pushed together in others until leads were completely closed   and the last
strong convergence event took place. A convergence event is one where ice floes
collide and are pressed against each other with such force that they break up
and pressure ridges are formed.

Commentator:  Whereas the helicopter pilots work at an altitude of several
kilometres [Ed. sic – this is really what he said – I know it’s nonsense], the
marine biologists are researching at a depth of several kilometres and made a
rather remarkable discovery.

Christian Haas: A special highlight of each week are the net catches of the
biologists, who lower their nets several thousand metres deep into the ocean
from the side of the ship and catch a variety of living organisms including
algae, zooplankton, small amphipods and jellyfish.   The shrimp-like amphipods
are the most numerous.  But this week we had a rather special surprise, because
we caught a ca. 10-centimetre-long animal that was a very bright red. We
haven’t  identified it yet, because there are so many different species that
not every  biologist can be expected to identify them all immediately, but
because it looked like a cucumber we called it “Gurki” [Ed. “Gurki” is a
diminutive form of the German word for cucumber  “Gurke”]

Commentator:  You will be able to find out whether a suitable site can be found
for building the landing strip and what new findings there are from the various
scientific investigations  in the next installment of Arctic-Drift the  Audio
Logbook.

Commentator: AUDIO NOW.

    Furious winds in seven days according to ECMWF

That gradient would give rise to a strong CCW cyclonic push towards the Fram.
The last of the CW circulation right now is sending the Polarstern that way at
a rapid clip. GFS foresees another 18 hours of this before the ship is becalmed
and even moves back the other way. Bow radar has been uneventful so far during
this run towards Svalbard.

The new SIC-Leads product gives a considerably more nuanced picture of ice pack
motion than gridded OsiSaf. The lead images are difficult to adjust though
'equalize' the grayscale histogram gives a quick over-exposed look that doesn't
overlook the small cracks.

    Today’s afternoon we crossed 85N but couldn’t see the grid line due to
    heavy snow storms. However, the ridged second-year sea ice and its thick
    snow layer on top slows us consistently down.

If so, the KD is still 3º of latitude away from the PS so 330 km plus some
longitude; going will be slower in thicker ice and 15 m/s wind so maybe 1 km/hr
or ~336 hrs which is 14 days, a lot later than planned. The KD was held up by
Barents waves for a week or more. Leads cannot be assumed to stay open under
conditions of compressive stress and pressure ridges are everywhere this year.
Both ships will be in the pole hole of most satellites for weeks.

2h @CKatlein
Today we had a short power blackout in the Central Observatory of
MOSAiC, anyways all heaters are running and all systems are warm and
cozy again. Strong winds mostly kept us inside the vessel for the day.
 
Feb 12
While our supply icebreaker is still 200 miles away making 1-2 knots [2.8 km
hr], we get to experience the first twilight at 87.8° N. The  icedrift takes us
further north with a speed of 0.3 knots [0.6 km/hr]

The buoy array data is already being used, as it should, to study error in
various sea ice motion products. Is TL is aware of or using the Sic-Leads
product yet?

    What we have discovered so far, which is something really new, is how salt
    from ice gets into snow. We knew that snow can be very salty, but now we
    have pictures of pockets of brine water in snow. This is important for how
    snow looks from space. It means that it looks more similar to sea ice.We
    might think that the ice is getting thicker where, in reality, there's just
    more (salty) snow on it. Then we have an error in estimates.

Please. This was known and published long ago, just google upward extrusion of
brine pockets in maturing sea ice. Yes, this could improve satellite
interpretation if only we knew where and how much.

Decent offering today at FoMo -- a top and bottom DEM of the Mosaic floe and
surroundings on youtube which is converted to mp4 below (because the the
youtube controller is so annoying in not looping and moving on to unwanted
material ... take the spaces out of https://youtu.be   /KJf5XOkB5m0 to see).

Nothing is labelled; no distance or height scale or Ice Camp locations are
shown. The Polarstern is the dark squiggle. This is not expert use of display
software by any means but it is a good start and a breakthrough for FoMo in
terms of an interesting post.

It would have been better simply to have done an annotated slide show of the
best views rather than the clumsy fly-through. That could include a plan view
grayscale of the two DEM data layers. Every frame is angled though. Two
screenshots are shown below.

Question is, if the floe is in hydrostatic equilibrium shouldn't the bottom be
predictable from the top (apart from density altering inclusions). That is,
with a free-floating ice berg, 10% is above the water and 90% below. Here
though the overall contiguity of the ice pack and resultant mechanical strength
over-ride the buoyant tendencies of individual pieces.

Now, where to put that airstrip?
Here showing most Mosaic IABP buoys that report on the hour. Some report only
on the half hour. Inset is nullschool wind isobaric at 1000hpa. Frames are
repeated twice to match the hourly buoys. Projection is done using PlotSvalbard

Given the lack of scales, it is very difficult to make out what is what on the
surface and undersides of the Mosaic floe from the youtube provided. In
particular, the top priority area is really in front of the bow radar, covered
every six hours since 01 Nov 19 but not yet interpreted. Met City etc aren't
located; the sensor area is already illuminated by nautical twilight.

This would have been better done as side by side hill-shaded digital elevation
models or as user-controlled joy stick as done for surface and basement rocks
of some Greenland glaciers. One issue is the very different scales -- the
surface heights being about a ninth of underwater keel depths. This alone is a
good reason for just providing unadorned grayscale DEMs and letting users take
it from there. The attached mp4 reverses colors as the blue is harder to follow
than its orange.

The Polarstern, after a prolonged episode of high winds and rapid motion, is
now becalmed at 88.0 80.3 at noon on 20-02-14 UTC. The passage across the outer
arm of the Chukchi anti-cyclone at about midnight on Feb 14th may have resulted
in shearing but that won't show until tomorrow. The bow radar is swinging
wildly suggesting that one or more sea ice anchors have come undone in the
prolonged 14-15 m/s winds.

Looking ahead to the extreme low pressure in FJL, that is not foreseen to
result in extreme winds at the Polarstern's position. A sharp gradient to
nearby high pressure is needed for strong winds.

    The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) today cancelled the
    Europe-wide call for tenders for the procurement of a new polar research
    vessel, Polarstern II, for legal reasons. In times of unresolved climate
    issues, the research mission of the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz
    Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) can only be fulfilled in the
    long term with a modern icebreaker. This understanding is also shared by
    the BMBF. Therefore, we will work intensively with the BMBF to find a
    solution, which also aims to set up a new award procedure. Among other
    things, the experiences from the current MOSAiC expedition will be
    incorporated into the planning process in order to develop an icebreaker
    that is as future-proof, powerful and sustainable as possible.

    Exchange between #MOSAiC leg 2 and 3 was planned for tomorrow (15 Feb).
    However the supply icebreaker is still 168 miles away [270 km] and in the
    last
    hour moved less than 1000m. #naturewins


In other words, the KD is practically stuck with 270 km of much thicker ice to
cross (though pressure ridges may be the problem this year, not the
thermodynamically thickened). At this rate, the KD is 270 hours away (15.4
days) except that's optimistic since the Polarstern drifted 20.4 km away in the
last 29 hours.

S1AB today should show the KD's track, except there may not be one if the
previous track has sealed over and they are not making a new one. We know more
or less where to look from S Arnd's post the other day about crossing 85ºN.
Believe that's it's track below 85.1461 80.6331 at 05:47 on 14 Feb 2020. The
Polarstern was at 88.0 80.9 at that hour.

If abrupt wind stress gradients matter for disruption of the ice pack, the PS
bow radar tomorrow could be interesting in terms of shear.

Technical note: despite the PS not disclosing its position and no S1AB
coverage, when there is a break from in the latitude decimal, it means the ship
crossed 87.9000 and 88.0000 parallels, though in the latter instance, the PS
didn't transmit its weather for 3 hours.

I haven't got time to make a video. Storm Dennis has arrived!

However I believe this currently reveals KD top left and PS bottom right:

    KD yellow circle, PS magenta circle

Looks about right. The KD may be aiming east of the PS in order to catch the
transpolar drift (instead of fighting it). If the ships are drifting in
opposite directions, the KD could struggle all day with the ice but end up
farther away from the Polarstern than when it started.

So bizarre: providing routine blog text only as a png image. It just takes a
second though to run it through free online Danish OCR (https://convertio.co/
ocr/danish/) and then google-translate.

"Tomorrow there is a general clean-up and a single trip out on the ice to drill
cores in the EMIRAD measurement area near the ship.

The other morning, when I was with the chemistry team at the "dark site" and
taking samples, I saw a slight light to the south on the horizon. "Dark site"
is so far from the ship that there is no light pollution, and therefore you can
see even the faintest shades of light.

I took a picture of the horizon with my mobile camera, but when I got home and
looked at the picture, it looked like I had turned off the phone. It was
completely black and there was no hint of light. The sun is still far below the
horizon, and it's not even twilight, but we've got the moon back and it gives
some light when we're out.

Last weekend we had a strong low pressure with strong winds and temperature
fluctuations. Saturday morning started with blizzard and 20 m / s and
temperature of about -12 degrees.
During the day the wind subsided while the temperature dropped to -38 degrees
towards evening.

The captain had forbidden going out on the ice in the morning, and I spent most
of the day in the "cold lab" working with ice samples from our measuring range.
"Cold lab" is a container on the back deck which is designed for laboratory.
The laboratory has -15 degrees, so you can work with your snow and ice samples
without melting. Compared to the outside temperature, it feels warm in the lab.

I am working on mapping the composition of the ice cream; the size and
distribution of air bubbles and the distribution of salt in the ice. It affects
what we measure with our satellite instruments, which is why it is important to
be able to develop computer models.

There is still some wind, but the temperature was only -15 degrees when we were
out digging our instruments out of the drivers."

R Tonboe has an English language twitter site but has not posted anything since
27 Nov 19. His interests with Mosaics are remote sensing, ice team and ESA
radiometer. His 2019-20 papers:

Quote

    Version 2 of the EUMETSAT OSI SAF and ESA CCI sea-ice concentration climate
    data records

The Kapitan Dranitsyn is not making much forward motion today. It is visible on
the animation up to about 06:00 on Feb 16th. It is a challenge to meet up not
only because of the ice but because the  two ships experience different (and
changing) drift trajectories.

    publish diary as text

The concept: a hardy explorer pecking out a diary on a courier typewriter like
in days of olde? Nansen had electric lights already on the Fram. The PS has two
bars, a sauna and a swimming pool.

Meanwhile, the Kapitan Dranitsyn has advanced 34.7 km in the last 21 hours. Not
all of it was in the direction of the Polarstern,  only about 14 km. The zigzag
route yields an effective linear approach speed of 16 km/day which means 18
more days till docking with the Polarstern, say early March. And delays will be
similar or worse for those returning to Tromsø.

Because the ice is drifting, getting to the Polarstern is like crossing a
river: start quite a ways upstream, not right across. That's not an easy
calculation though, a lot of imponderables:

If the KD is moving at x(t) m/s at bearing a(t) under steam but the ice around
it is drifting y(t) m/s at bearing b(t), how many days does it take, given the
GFS wind forecast f(t) to reach the PS which is not under steam but has been
drifting at z(t) m/s at bearing c(t)? Nansen's rule of thumb was the icepack
drifts at 2% of the wind speed at an angle of 20-40% to it from the Coriolis
effect.

The KD is probably not doing the math here but instead just seeking a pragmatic
route that avoids thickest pressure ridges. Those could be more prevalent than
in the past because ice pack motion has gotten measurably worse.

Meanwhile, the current Polarstern scientific team is still deploying equipment
4.5 months after mooring. These instruments have to installed far from the
lights of the ship which would disturb what they are trying to measure. The
location has not been disclosed. The acronyms ITBOB, ENVI-POPE and AZFP stand
for:

-- Ice-tethered bio-optical properties and radiation
-- Platform  cluster for Optical,  Physical and Ecological sensors
-- Acoustic Zooplankton Fish Profiler

The KD has been making better progress north, aided by ice pack drift. A long
section of track is outlined in yellow in the gif below, needs click. Meanwhile
the Polarstern is drifting west. The extreme low pressure system coming to the
Barents will have little effect on winds which will remain sub-gale force.

    New snowbuoy 2020S99. A touch south east of p207.

"This buoy replaces 2019S92, which was crashed during a ridging event." Does
that mean inactive 82, 83, 85, 88-91, 95, 97, 98 met similar fates?

On the inactive snowbuoy setting, they only show 2019S95 which was operative
for 6 days at the M7 site co-deployed with 2019O7 and 2019T71:

2019S79   86.00   119.17   07.10.19-28.11.19 (52)    
2019S80   85.96   122.71   08.10.19-02.11.19 (26)
2019S92   86.04   117.73   07.10.19-26.11.19 (50)
2019S95   84.62   133.29   11.10.19-17.10.19 (6)

2019S81   88.25   85.17   07.10.19
2019S84   86.49   109.32   07.10.19
2019S86   88.16   69.44   10.10.19       
2019S87   88.40   81.98   09.10.19       
2019S93   88.04   80.39   07.10.19       
2019S94   88.20   74.00   10.10.19    
2019S96   88.08   77.50   29.10.19
2020S99   87.96   75.37   10.02.20

"2019S92 was at the L1 site, co-deployed with 2019R9, 2019W4, 2019I1, 2019F1,
2019T67, one ASFS, one MARC" so we could determine from S92 where the
mysterious L1 site is relative to the Polarstern.

Ditto 2019S93 which was co-deployed at L2 with 2019R8, 2019W2, 2019I2, 2019T63,
2019T65, 2019F2, ASFS, MARC

The ASFS (Shure's sonic atmo sled, see above) that "got eaten by a pressure
ridge" was at L3. They got that unburied on 15 Feb 2020 according to FoMo but
it is not yet functioning. At the L1-3 sites, they are trying to do air, ice,
ocean in coordination so it hurts to have a major component down.

2019S94 was co-deployed at L3 with 2019M30, 2019W3, 2019T70, 2019I3, 2019F3,
ASFS, UNMANNED-ICE-PRIC

Today at 03:00 the L2 site was at lat lon 88.0420  80.3936 whereas the PS was
at 88.1  77.9 per awiMET which is 11.4 km away. The PS can be located slightly
better using RAMMB (at 03:27 at 88.074  77.85) which is 10.21 km away but the
last known precise location for the PS from S1AB was on 2020 02 02 at 05:46
87.3446   95.4993.

Given a similar calculation for L1 and L3, the three lines could be visualized
on GoogEarth where they would not quite radiate out consistently from the PS
location because of error but be very close to displaying the overall
configuration. Following the L123 triangle over time would show rotation.

Although difficult to see on Sentinel, the KD is still 263 km away from the
Polarstern but winds remain moderate (despite the nearby 953 hPa low) and ice
pack motion is favorable for trajectory convergence. It's not unusual for ships
and explorers get caught on a treadmill where despite a whole day's effort,
they make no progress towards their goal. That's not happening here (to the
extent the KD can make headway).

Hopefully PS and KD are ok in deep water.

    Given a similar calculation for L1 and L3

Tbuoy gps appear to be struggling somewhat. Wbuoys didn't last long. I and
Fbuoys??
An equal combination of R8(L2), R9(L1) and S94(L3) gives the estimated PS
location below. It looks a bit too far west. I'll run it back to known location
points, it could work.

added jan5-15 as a test. Red dots are S1 calculated PS locations (timing not

    Earthquake M 5.2 - North of Svalbard  2020-02-18   85.740°N 22.699°

This site is called the Sparsely Magmatic Zone (SMZ) of the Gakkel Ridge. Only
one large volcanic center at 19° E has been noted over the entire extent of
this segment.

JD calculated years ago on another forum that even when the volcano field
erupted a bit east in the Eastern Volcanic Zone (EVZ), the amount of heat
released was utterly inconsequential as far as melting Arctic Ocean ice or even
for turbulent disruption of the salinity and thermal layers.

Did the 1999 earthquake swarm on Gakkel Ridge open a volcanic conduit?https://
link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10950-009-9179-6

In 1999, a seismic swarm of 237 teleseismically recorded events marked a
submarine eruption along the Arctic Gakkel Ridge, later on also analyzed by
sonar, bathymetric, hydrothermal, and local seismic studies... We find event
locations scattered around 85°35′ N and 85° E at the southern rift wall and
inside the rift valley of the Gakkel Ridge.

FoMo released a new map of the area around the ship today! It is reproduced
below as their enlarged view 1696 x 1620 pixels (at which text is readable) so
needs a click and large device screen. A dozen or two acronyms are not
explained in the Legend.

No map scale is provided; however the PS measures 118 m, indicating the large
squares are 500 m and the dotted smaller squares 100m.

There is no labelled lat lon graticule and north is not indicated as it varies
with drift but is more or less at the top, going by recent S1AB with
graticules. A near-vertical line of the grid system runs through something
called nav(0,0) but the horizontal lines have no special relationship to nav
(0,0). The grid appears set to be parallel / perpendicular to the Polarstern's
bow-stern axis, which makes some sense the ice camp is accessed off the
starboard side.

The map only includes 1000 pixels of the area mapped daily by the ice radar
which points out 1310 pixels (2.5 km) from the bridge. Oddly an overlay of the
bow radar does not have any features matching the runway.

The bluish-white base map appears to be heights determined by the laser
altimeter patched together from helicopter overflights on different days. No
scale (z axis) is provided but generally white indicates pressure ridges and
surface ice jumbles. Some of these represent summer floe-building collisions
and were already present at mooring back on Oct 4th; others are newer (not
indicated despite symbols for leads and ridges in the legend).

Starting at the top left, the text overlays can be assigned png mouse-over x,y
pixel coordinates and analyzed in a sortable database, sampler below and full
csv attached.

The Remote Sensing site (RS on the map) acknowledged the loss of three
instruments yesterday: KuKa, X-Scat and Elbara (a passive L-band 1.4 GHz
smos-type radiometer). No spare parts are available on board, none are coming
with the KD and implausibly by air on leg 4. (L Kaleschke's research involves
Elbara; he is on the KD.)

No explanation has been given for three devices all failing (unsuitable
connectors? power supply is from the PS). UWBRAD, an ultra-wideband 0.5–2GHz
radiometer, is still working as is the SSMI radiometer (19, 37, 89 GHz) and the
GNSS-R.

This is a major loss for remote sensing improvement. No summary of total trip
up-time been provided. J Stroeve wrote about problems back on Dec 1st, tweeting
"Our radar is once again connected to the power while some instruments are
still awaiting connection."

The map term GNSS occurs in three places. Probably GNSS-R was intended for
reflected GNSS signals from snow/ice  which relate to ice thickness, altimetry
and scatterometry of various types of satellite GPS-like signals.

https://epic.awi.de/id/eprint/50082/1/Expeditionsprogramm_PS122_leg2.pdf pg 87

Technical inspection of the new map establish it as a disturbingly amateurish
product given its importance to operation planning and communications. Surely a
shipload of scientists on a $150,000,000 budget stuck on board for days at a
time by weather could muster up someone onboard or ashore with basic graphics
skills (such as editable layer compositing). They will need a journal-quality
map later ... and this is not it.

PS continued drifting north west. With the current cyclone, perhaps the two
teams will share the most northerly location in a few days time.

    @CKatlein 6h Finally our resupply icebreaker is so much delayed, that
    Polarstern has reopened the bar! #MOSAiC

That storm coming up from the Caribbean has morphed into a strong cyclone that
is now predicted to drift across the FJL line into the Arctic basin and past
close to the Polarstern as it gradually dissipates, even as a new system comes
in.

This will significantly complicate the rendezvous of the KD and Polarstern as
their drifts will be affected differently. At these stronger wind stress
gradients, the Ice Camp experimental area may have more problems with pressure
ridges, opening leads and shear lines. So far ice motion has been limited to
shears on the periphery. (Much higher winds occurred earlier on the drift:
20-02-01 20 m/s.)

The KD appears to be at 86.4771  89.8613 at 05:55 this morning though the track
on Sentinel is ambiguous and Rammb is cloudy. If so, with the Polarstern at
88.25  74.4 and moving rapidly west, the two ships are separated by 211 km with
a rendezvous maybe ten days off.

Temperatures have already risen by 15º and winds are quite a bit stronger than
GFS had foreseen yesterday (or rather, the discrepancy between observed
shipboard winds and GFS winds has widened). These temperatures per se are still
too cold and transient to melt ice but the Kara/Barents/FJL ice will be greatly
dispersed and disrupted.

The Polarstern continues to drift rapidly north and west in high winds and
driving snow associated with the warm wet cyclone moving slowly across the
Arctic Basin from FJL. Staff is confined to the ship under these conditions
which will persist for the next couple of days.

FoMo is reporting hazardous ice motion (creating snow-covered open water) but
these leads are not yet showing on the PS bow radar. These will worsen because
of the ice pack cannot follow the sharp curvature of the wind. Meanwhile on-ice
instruments may need repair but cannot be serviced. On Feb 13th, the whole
Central Observatory experienced a brief (unexplained) power blackout.

The KD is not showing on RAMMB because of cloud cover though the PS has been
visible at times. Its location is not known because it does not post a weather
report nor turn on its beacon. It is seeing similar weather to the PS and
drifting along the same streamline. It may be possible to pick up on its
Sentinel track from yesterday and find a current position.

Uniq provides the AMSR2 view on the freeze forum today #929:

The Polarstern continues to fly north and west under the cyclone. It is visible
on RAMMB but the KD is not (nor does it provide its location).

Iain provides a WorldView visible animation of the CAA Perry ice bridge and
compared to earlier years #925. That area has been monitored with an
observatory of moorings for years.

These can also be visualized using the new SIC lead product from L Kaleschke,
the last 60 days below. Unfortunately it does not going any farther west than
shown. He is on the KD and seemingly unreachable.

I find it particularly interesting that the leads and apparent wave structures
move through the ice rather than with it, the PS' slow progress is the best
indication of this I've seen. The emergent double features indicates an
acceleration?

OsiSaf gives another view, more along the lines of wind-induced. Ascat over 81
days gives yet another perspective, of smooth flow.

The Polarstern will continue to move rapidly poleward and towards the Fram this
week under the influence of cyclones passing over Greenland. If it does reach
the pole, it may be stuck in that area for quite a while as that ice is off the
transpolar drift in most years.

The ship is currently at record lat lon of 88.5 66.2 on 20-02-21 at 15:00 with
warm persistent winds in the 13 m/s range which are borderline for outdoor
work. The Kapitan Dranitsyn is 184.1 km (still a week away) as of noon today at
87.06 89.1, with progress reported slowed by the same storm. Neither ship will
be visible on Sentinel over the next weeks though the wavy KD track is
available at 04:50 this morning.

Verifying those large low concentration leads north of Greenland.

drift update. Below 45E they start drifting away from the pole. At the recent
rate of ~3degrees/day that's maybe 5-6days away. KD might just make it.

A steady tailwind bearing for 56 hours produced the incredible straight drift
of the proxy buoys for the Polarstern seen in Uniq's #635 animation above.
Chasing down the stats, the ice pack moved at 2.1% the speed of the 1000 hPa
wind (confirming what 'they' have been saying for years).

This wouldn't be possible without unresisting exits for the ice such as Fram,
Nares and SV-FJL gap because the ice pack cannot compress further against land.
(Over-rafting pressure ridges provide too much pushback when the ice is thick.)

Data from awiMet should someone wish to refine the estimate by providing the
std error:

Both ImageJ and Gimp offer image enhancement by convolution kernels, both
canned (Process -> shadows) and roll-your-own DIY. They have a very beneficial
effect on the Kaleschke SIC lead product (and downstream overlays), enhancing
lead visualization without blowing up the grayish white interstitial background
like linear contrast change, local adaptive (clahe) or histogram equalization.

To the extend the leads are anisotropic -- and they will be from TPD or during
passage of a cyclone -- the choice of convolution 'direction' matters. The mp4
below used 'northeast'. No rocket science is involved automating out from the
canned convolution to converge onto a quasi-optimal element of GL(3,R) wrt to
frame average and that extends to a rolling window of GFS winds.

While some people are twittering from the KD, others are not. Kaleschke did not
have time to describe productions methods but it is clear from Uniq's
remarkable match-up in#635 of microwave leads with WorldView infrared that SIC
leads just takes a longer radar wavelength approach to heat escaping through
the ice. The images can't help but agree.

In other words, low Ghz radar meets up with long wavelength infrared in the
electromagnetic spectrum, the difference being WV infrared is at the mercy of
cloud cover while low Ghz sees through them better (in winter). It benefits
from processing to darken warmer regions (ie the leads). We don't know what
processing steps were taken but clearly they can be improved for the purpose of
overlays on GFS weather,  Ascat scatterometry etc etc which don't see the leads
but have other, complementary strengths.

The tripods have proven a planning and operational fiasco. Just drill through
the ice, freeze in some 5 m fiberglass poles with no guy wires, hang slack
electric and data cables off them, your pressure ridge problems are over. And
where did Mosaic get their no-go snowmobiles, out of a museum?

Thanks for those calculations. Here looking a little closer at the direction
change to close to due west. Drift speed picking up again after the turn.

Although RAMMB has been showing the Kapitan Dranitsin closing in on the rapidly
drifting Polarstern by the end of February, visibility from above is often
obscured by clouds. It now appears that the KD is stuck in the thicker colder
ice nearer the pole (as predicted above), still 100 km from the PS.

That is not an impossible distance for helicopter exchange of leg2/leg3
scientists and for transfer of experimental matériel but flight conditions are
currently far from acceptable: gale-force 15m/s at 15:00 at 88.6 53.3 on Feb
24th. The KD was able to un-stick itself returning last time by shifting fuel
from port to starboard tanks.

Follow-Mosaic speaks of multiple Twin Otter landings maybe being feasible on
unprepared airstrips at both the KD and PS sites but that potentially doubles
down on catastrophic risks without resolving the underlying issues.

The KD was supposed to bring extra fuel to the PS but now it seems if the KD
does that, it won't have enough fuel of its own to get back to Tromsø, so a
relief icebreaker for the relief icebreaker has to be considered.

Both ships are provisioned for up to a year so scientific work can continue at
least at the PS. Despite conditions, the ROV has been able to log over 80 km of
undersea ice mapping, even photographing that ringed seal investigating another
misaligned thermistor cable. (Because they couldn't find a suitable
'thermodynamic' floe back in October, the PS moored on a pressure ridge
jumble.)

Something has gone wrong at the ice radar archive. The heavy white scale bar is
now lying over the image, causing loss of data. This bar should never have been
placed here as ample black space was available in the masked region. It has
never been clear whether this represented compass NS; better had digital lat,
lon and ship axis bearing been placed above a km length scale bar. All that was
provided on the device screen but cropped out. The ice pack (and the embedded
PS) may be rotating more than anticipated.

Meanwhile the PS is moving west at an extraordinary rate of 0.4 ºlon/hr,
bringing it into an extreme fracturing zone caused by cyclones barreling in
through the SV-FJL gap instead of the usual winter path up the Fram. This
pattern has greatly enlarged the Fram intake funnel out beyond the north pole
(as noted here last week), with even the Lincoln Sea ice being drawn in. The
Polarstern will be located just to the right of the pole hole (ie 50º at
nullschool) later this afternoon.

From the MOSAIC web-app:

Quote

    Severe ice conditions in the Arctic currently delay the approach of
    the Russian supply vessel Kapitan Dranitsyn towards the
    Polarstern. Ideally, the vessel should reach Polarstern in the coming
    days, but weather and ice conditions are still difficult. That dense
    winter pack ice could delay the exchange phases between legs two
    and three was part of the expedition planning from the beginning
    and is thus not a surprising situation. Already in the planning phase
    we took into account that the supply vessel may not be able to
    reach Polarstern during the polar night. In such case it was planned
    to exchange personnel and cargo via the on-board helicopters of
    Polarstern. However, there are no suitable flight weather conditions
    at the moment. In parallel the feasibility of operating two polar Twir
    Otter aircraft is evaluated at the moment to ensure a faster
    exchange. Under certain conditions a Twin Otter is able to land on
    unprepared sea ice next to Kapitan Dranitsyn, but needs a safe
    landing strip at Polarstern and also flight weather conditions.
    Additionally, the possibility of support by another icebreaker is
    evaluated, that could steam towards Kapitan Dranitsyn to provide
    additional fuel on the way back when the same ice conditions will
    be encountered. In the meantime, scientists and crew onboard both
    vessels remain patient and wait for easing conditions in the next
    days. But most importantly: safety is not affected and there are
    enough supplies on both ships. The scientific activities continue on
    board Polarstern and are not affected by the situation. The picture
    of the day shows that the atmosphere on board Dranitsyn is good
    despite the delay. It is not clear yet when the exchange can be
    completely finished and which additional delays will arise for the
    future exchanges of scientific teams and the ship's crew. The
    options are well prepared and also discussed with the participants
    of leg 4 of the expedition. The necessary patience and flexibility
    needed by everyone to plan expeditions in unknown territory and
    under unknown weather conditions could not be described better as
    summed up by Berthold Brecht: "Ay, make yourself a plan, they need
    you at the top, then make yourself a second plan, then let the whole
    thing drop."

The KD has gotten itself stuck and unstuck multiple times before. The question
here is if they could, would they continue north to the Polarstern without
enough fuel for the return trip in thick ice? They could perfectly well moor
alongside the Polarstern and await the melt season.

This would be better for the scientific program. The KD itself does not carry
the Pistenbullys necessary to plow an 1800 m wheeled airplane runway but an
opportunity might arise for staff and crew exchanges.

If the KD cannot get itself unstuck, it might take several months to lease a
heavy duty nuclear icebreaker that could escort the KD to the Polarstern or
more likely back home. Most capable icebreakers are contracted out months or
even years in advance; the KD is not in an emergency situation.

Quote

    In the last few years the Kapitan Dranitsyn has been modified as a
    passenger vessel, with 49 outside cabins for 100 passengers. Public
    accommodation includes spacious lounges, bars, a heated swimming pool, gym,
    sauna, library and a small hospital. wiki

Air drops for both the KD and PS could bring in lighter essentials; these are a
whole lot safer than multiple landings on ungroomed airstrips which could bring
on emergencies for which there is no response.

One option not yet mentioned is for the more capable icebreaker Polarstern to
fire up its engines, go free up the KD and perhaps escort it south a bit, do
the exchanges, and return to wherever its current position has drifted. This
would leave the power (and data collection) off for a prolonged period at
deployment sites so more likely the many tons of irreplaceable scientific
equipment would have to pulled in first.

This would entail an enormous amount of de-installation and re-installation
work in high wind chill (but not dark) and seriously undermine the scientific
mission. Alternatively a skeleton crew and generator could be left in a
lifeboat equipped as shelter to keep things repaired and going.

On Rammb, the 60 frame time series is needed, color the dot pairs you're sure
of. The PS also responded to a change in wind bearing around the same time. The
longitude of the KD can be estimated easily enough but latitude retrieval
depends on including the outer 85º circle in the time series (on the extremely
flighty Rammb display) so that the number of pixels to 87.5º can be measured to
proportion the KD's location.

Since GFS nullschool gives the same wind speed and direction wherever you click
(within reason), the KD and PS will have the same drift as long as neither is
under steam. The short cut is just to count pixels between the two Rammb dots
over time: if constant, the KD is still stuck.

It's interesting to read people onboard the PS are hoping the KD can get
closer, needn't actually get to the PS. Presumably that makes multiple round
trips a lot easier for the helicopters. The PS has two and the KD a larger one.
Closer though means more problematic for the KD crew and leg2 scientists in
terms of returning home, though possibly the outbound broken swath could be
re-used.

Update: persistent strong winds over the last 36 hours are pushing the local
icepack rapidly west, taking the Polarstern with it at a record clip of 0.4º
lon/hr. More of the same is forecast for the  next 72 hours with an increasing
southerly component.  The KD is no longer on a streamline to the PS but rather
on a parallel one heading to the the FJL gap.
 
This will leave the PS at perhaps 88.3 20.0 by the first of March, leaving the
ship 857 km from its 15 Oct 2020 final destination in near-prime transpolar
drift position that could end the mission by the first of June some 4 1/2
months early.

Agreed, I should have taken account of that.

that feb23 ~20:45 was as far north as they go. An accurate PS location is not

    The MOSAiC ice floe: sediment-laden survivor from the Siberian shelf

    We show, using a Lagrangian tracking tool and a thermodynamic sea ice
    model, that the MOSAiC floe carrying the Central Observatory (CO) formed in
    a polynya event north of the New Siberian Islands at the beginning of
    December 2018. The results further indicate that sea ice in the vicinity of
    the CO (< 40 km distance) was younger and 36 % thinner than the surrounding
    ice with potential consequences for ice dynamics and momentum and heat
    transfer between ocean and atmosphere.

We're getting mixed signals at the moment: is the KD stuck or just proceeding
slowly, has it already exhausted so much fuel it cannot get back to Norway, is
another icebreaker passing by in the vicinity capable of refueling it? Both
bloggers onboard have gone silent.

The Rammb frames on which both ships are visible do not show the KD closing on
the PS. That is consistent with either the KD being stuck or just making very
slow progress.

Quote

    The "Kapitan Dranitsyn" supply icebreaker is barely making any progress.
    "The mood on board the Polarstern is very tense," said Chief Scientist
    Professor Christian Haas. "There is uncertainty as to how to proceed. The
    colleagues are disappointed that there is no foreseeable return soon.

    But since mid-December the sea ice in the winter arctic has grown steadily,
    it is up to 160 centimeters thick and provided with many dense press ice
    ridges by stormy winds. Open and thin jobs are rare. And so the KD is
    struggling slowly - with such high energy consumption that the fuel will
    not be enough to return to Norway. 

    Ideally the KD will reach PS in the next few days, the expedition blog led
    by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) says: "However, the
    weather and ice conditions are still adverse."

    Markus Rex expects the KD to reach Polarstern in the next few days. It is
    only 50 nautical miles away.  She had made good progress in the past 24
    hours. Rex says planes are also available in Canada. But better weather is
    also needed for their use.

    Chief Christian Haas says  it was presumptuous to believe that in
    mid-February a conventionally operated ship would get to the central
    Arctic. There is no experience with it, not even with the "Kapitan
    Dranitsyn".

    Haas believes that the winter journey should have been planned for a longer
    period than the two months planned. "Of course we have a luxury problem,"
    he admits. Researchers today did not want to be away from home for longer
    than two or three months. "We are happy and excited to be here," emphasizes
    Haas. The food is also good. But the team is now very exhausted from work
    and is longing for a more relaxed time.

Will the PS reach the North Pole?
No. Forget the spaghetti models, just look at GFS wind. The ship is already
below the pole and proceeding west and south where the transpolar drift will
take over. Nothing in the recent past is relevant to the ice thinness and wind
patterns this year. The circumpolar drift from the Laptev to Fram has been
going on for many millennia.

https://t.co/DC5NfoNfSB?amp=1

Is it surprising the Mosaic floe contains sediment from the Siberian shelf?
No. Where else could the ice have formed, given its posted track from Ascat? If
there is no dueling hypothesis, there is no information content.

On WorldView, the Laptev Sea can be seen to be awash in algal bloom and fine
sediment (from between islands, from melting coastal and submerged yedoma, from
Lena Delta) in late August (see early locked posts on this forum). The only
surprise would be coarse sediment too dense to have been suspended long,
indicating a role for land-fast ice.

https://t.co/DC5NfoNfSB?amp=1

As explained some years back by Pink Floyd, we don't need no education to
answer such questions ("Another Brick in the Wall").

Thanks for the updates! A-Team talks about their predicament being a "luxury
problem". Indeed, all on this forum should have mandatory reading of "The
Kingdom of Ice" about the De Long party in the Jenette. (Spelling may be wrong)
One of the best books I ever read, it shows to what incredible lengths humans
are able to go in order to survive. When De Long and company finally make it to
land, it happens to be the most remote place on earth...unbelievable

In The Kingdom of Ice: The Grand and Terrible Polar Voyage of the USS Jeannette
(Doubleday), 2014, by author and historian Hampton Sides.

Per Wikipedia:  The book tells the true story of the 1879–1881 arctic voyage of
the USS Jeannette and the crew's struggle to survive after having to abandon
their ship in the polar ice.

I read it a few years ago:  extremely intense in places, and worth the read.

    unstuck

Indeed, the variable rate of KD closing on the Polarstern in this morning can
be measured (in units of pxls/51 min in the 34 frames of uniq's #651), 72 km to
go. Question is, does the KD have enough fuel to get back to Norway a week from
now?

If the KD can maintain a speed of 1 knot above the ice pack drift, that would
be two days for a rendezvous on Feb 28/Mar 01 to the south and west of the PS's
current location at 88.50 41.2 at 07:42 this morning.

Winds are fairly strong right now at 12 m/s. That will complicate or even delay
crane unloading for a few days though not personnel swapping. The Polarstern is
currently a bit to the right and below the pole hole of Sic-Leads but is
drifting into the currently active fracture zone.

Earlier I noted the parallels of latitude in Uniquorn's GIFs had 0.1º spacing. 
So is the PS at 98.7ºN or just 33 km from the NP?

    Is the Polarstern close to the North Pole?

No. It was at 88.5044  41.20 this morning which is as close to the pole as it
will ever get, 166.3 km away. To see what happens next, load grid-on nullschool
with the lat lon for Polarstern from awiMet and draw radial latitudinal and
tangential longitudinal components of wind stress as shown below. The PS will
be moving south and west at 3:1 proportions, with longitude losing 0.2º per
hour (1.450 km/hr).

    A quick look at overall buoy drift for feb1-24. Quite a lot of dropouts
    recently.

Using the IABP buoy archive, there appear to be 79 working buoys (reporting on
25-27 Feb) and 31 that have failed (not reported in a  week or more).

The ones closest to the Polarstern can be found by first sorting the attached
database for those closest to the ship in longitude, then sorting that subset
by latitude which is more important to closeness.

Yes. It's quite a long list. Some report on the hour, some on the half hour,
some on both, some every 6hours. One doesn't report for 2 random hours around
lunchtime. I think it is French. Thermistor buoys have great temperature data
but poor location data at the moment. Both whoi ITP buoy's profilers are dead,
probably out of power, though itp102 still reporting location. The SIMB's had
datetime ahead of all the others(when I last looked).
p201,p204 and p207 are the nearest, most reliable that report roughly every
30mins. My favourites. :)
Obviously I would prefer a regular accurate location for PS.

From the MOSAIC web app:

Quote

    Yesterday morning we had flight weather conditions and took the
    chance to fly over to Kapitan Dranitsyn as she was less than 50
    miles away. Our helicopter picked up the chief scientist of leg 3
    Torsten Kanzow and nautical officer Igor Hering. They are replacing
    our leg 2 co-chief scientist Benjamin Rabe and nautical officer Lutz
    Peine now. Unfortunately, visibility decreased after that flight and
    we had to cancel the exchange of additional people to allow them
    to prepare their measurements. But in the meantime, Kapitan
    Dranitsyn makes good progress towards the Polarstern and was
    only twelve miles away this morning. We hope that they will arrive
    at their designated mooring position one kilometer east of the
    Polarstern by tomorrow and allow us to start the cargo operations
    and handover.

drift (edit:updated below), some Tbuoys and some dots approaching each other

https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JTECH-D-13-00058.1       2013
Quote

    This paper describes the development of a novel autonomous platform and
    sensor that replaces the traditional thermistor strings for monitoring
    temperature profiles in the ice and snow using a chain of inexpensive
    digital temperature chip sensors linked by a single-wire data bus. By
    incorporating a heating element into each sensor, the instrument is capable
    of resolving material
    interfaces (e.g., air–snow and ice–ocean boundaries) even under isothermal
    conditions. The instrument is small,low cost, and easy to deploy. Field and
    laboratory tests of the sensor chain demonstrate that the technology can
    reliably resolve material boundaries to within a few centimeters. The
    discrimination between different media based on sensor thermal response is
    weak in some deployments and efforts to optimize the performance continue.
    <>
    One weakness of the SAMS IMB buoy is the deployment disturbs the snow–ice
    system. This is particularly true for the snow, which may have poor contact
    with the chain if the hole is not carefully drilled and refilled. If the
    ice has positive freeboard, then the top section will be air or snow
    filled.As the hole refreezes, this air gap will be left but may
    subsequently fill with snow or flood and refreeze. In summer, the presence
    of the chain through the snow may cause increased solar energy absorption
    and speed the melt of the snow. Further tests of the effect of the physical
    presence of the IMB buoy are warranted.

    We did it! It is incredible but we finally arrived at RV Polarstern - only
    100 nm away from the North Pole - in the middle of Arctic winter.

    At 14:17 ships time, we reached our final parking position - with an

Here is an English translation of a transcript of instalment 13 of the Arctic
drift podcast posted on the MOSAiC website that is otherwise only available in
German.

This time the podcast is almost up to date because it refers to events that
happened on the 27th of February, one day before the Dranitsyn managed to reach
the Polarstern.  It reveals the problems that have been encountered in 
maintaining the emergency  landing strip because of ice movements and that the
expedition has probably experienced its closest approach to the Pole. It also
includes a contribution from the new expedition leader Torsten Kanzow, who
tells listeners something about the mood of his team. 

Installment 13 – Delay of Provisioning Icebreaker, Airstrip kaput and a seal.

Introduction: The next leg of the MOSAiC Expedition is already coming to an
end. However, the arrival of the Russian icebreaker Dranitsyn for provisioning
and crew exchange has been considerably delayed.  Naturally, most  of the
existing scientific projects continue, but there are others that, because the
Arctic dawn (return of daylight) is beginning, should be begun as soon as
possible. For the third leg of the expedition,  Torsten Kanzow will take over
the position of expedition leader on the Polarstern from  Christian Haas.
Commentator: Arctic Drift,  the Audio Logbook.

Christian Haas: Our current position is 88 degrees, 30 minutes North and 39
degrees  48 minutes East. That‘s about 90 miles from the North Pole and the
Dranitsyn, the ice breaker with our supplies and exchange crew that we are so
eagerly awaiting, is located about 30 miles to the South.[Ed.: According to the
data on the MOSAiC webpage, this makes the date of this recording the 27th
February]

Commentator: The next leg of the MOSAiC Expedition is already coming to an end.
By the half-light of the Arctic dawn (the return of daylight) the crew
associated with Christian Haas, the leader of the expedition, is eagerly
awaiting the Russian icebreaker Dranitsyn with supplies and exchange crew,
whose arrival has be considerably delayed. The delay has consequences for
various types of measurements that should already have started. As a result,
it’s now important to coordinate the exchange of personnel and materials as
quickly as possible to avoid losing any more time.   

Christian Haas: The communication with the Dranitsyn is very difficult, because
it is only possible to speak with them via Satellite telephone, where there are
big lags in the conversation and the connection is often interrupted, or by
E-Mail, where it’s difficult to clarify complicated technical issues quickly
and clearly. Anyway, as soon as the weather allows, we are planning to make
additional flights to the Dranitsyn to bring more scientists here, in
particular to allow them to start the measurements that should be made during
the Arctic dawn, that’s just beginning.

Christian Haas: We haven’t just been sitting here doing nothing. Rather, we
used the delay period, that‘s now lasted about 2 weeks, to continue and
intensify our monitoring. The MOSAiC project is planned to continue for a whole
year and therefore it’s important to continue weekly measurements. We’ve done
that so the scientific projects are continuing routinely.   

Commentator: After the months-long persistent darkness of the polar night, the
Arctic dawn is beginning. Even among experience researchers this natural
spectacle evokes fascination and elation.

Christian Haas: We are still thrilled by the environment that surrounds us, and
by the moving around and work on the ice. Naturally, that’s become even more
fascinating because the sunrise is already beginning. Just today [Ed.: 27th
February] for the first time, because the sky was clear, we could really see
the ice we were standing on and orient ourselves without using our head lamps.
Despite this, many of us on board are of course also still a little incredulous
about the situation that our return home will be delayed by so many weeks,
which will result in a  lot of organizational and private problems

Commentator: The current monitoring programme will hardly be affected by the
delay in exchanging the crews. In fact, just the opposite has happened: in the
last few weeks some continuous 24-hour measurements that required a lot of
preparation could be carried out.

Christian Haas: In any case, among the recent scientific highlights is the fact
that we were in a position to continuously monitor the turbulent flows under
the ice for periods longer than 24 hours.  Turbulence measurements are very
important for being able to estimate how heat from the ocean can be transferred
to the ice and then to the air above the ice.    The strength of the turbulence
is dependent on the speed of the current flow and the roughness of the ice.
Normally we can only make these measurements during the day and when there is
good weather. What does that mean? The wind should be relatively calm and there
should be no drifting snow. But these are not conditions under which the
current flow is particularly strong and the turbulence correspondingly large.
For this reason, we made a special effort to make continuous 24-hour recordings
out in the oceanography tent.  Naturally that meant that we also had to ensure
safe working conditions 24 hours a day. People had to be on bear watch all the
time and shifts had to be organised to make sure that the monitoring was
continuous.

Christian Haas: Anyway, a further highlight was that we met the first seal on
our ice floe. The first time it was seen was only for a few moments in the ROV
tent (the ROV is our underwater robot), but for such a short time that nobody
was able to photograph it, so half-jokingly we doubted if the observation was
real. Then, just this week, the ROV’s dives took it for long distances under
the ice and in its livestream all at once we saw a seal appear, a ringed seal,
that we able to observe  catching Arctic cod directly under the ice.    This is
a very nice example of how the ice provides a habitat for microorganisms and
zooplankton, that are then eaten by fish, in this case arctic cod, of which we
see large numbers in our underwater video footage, but have not been able to
catch. The fish then serve as a food source for the seals.

Commentator: The specially constructed landing strip that, in emergencies,
would allow crew members to be flown out and supplies to be air lifted in was
damaged by strong ice movements. Temporarily a new area for it must be found,
but for the handover between legs 3 and 4 in April a kilometre-long strip will
be required.

Christian Haas: The airstrip was operational for five weeks and in really good
condition. But unfortunately, a week ago it was damaged. A split that went the
whole way through the floe also went through the middle of the landing strip
and divided  it into two parts. However, the crack was less than a metre wide
and on the next day we were already able to fill it with snow,  compacted snow,
so that planes would have been able to land again.  Sadly, two days after that,
because of continuing ice movements, the floe was disrupted again, but this
time the crack was much bigger, at least a metre and a half wide, so that one
couldn’t just jump over it. To make matters worse, one of our Pistenbullys,
these are the vehicles that we use to remove snow, smooth the ice and remove
pressure ridges, got stuck on the wrong side of the crack. After several days
we were able to bring the Pistenbully back to the ship over the slowly closing
crack. But then, there where the crack had been, the ice edges moved together
further and the thin ice that had formed in the meanwhile was squeezed out and
a pressure ridge formed where the crack had been.   Because the ice there was
particularly unstable, we haven’t been able to level the pressure ridge and
can’t use this part of the landing strip. But despite the storms of the last
few days we are in the process of extending the other part to the North so we
will have a new 500 metre long landing strip which, when the cracks to the
South have been mended, can be quickly extended to provide one a kilometre
long.

Commentator: Despite the demanding work on the ship, the scientists are still
able to devote some time to sporting activities that bring them ever closer to
the North Pole.

Christian Haas: A special kind of sport on arctic expeditions is that, for fun,
one is always trying to get as far north as possible and establish new records.
Therefore, we were particularly excited to see how far north we would come and
whether we would possibly get to the North Pole. During the last two weeks the
drift in a northerly direction was very strong and very  swift, so that we
really did approach to within 80 miles of the North Pole. Since then we are now
moving southwards and, because we are now in the downstream part of the Polar
Drift, it is unlikely that we will reach such a high latitude again. Therefore,
we are happy that, in all probability, we got to the northernmost point of the
MOSAiC expedition.  Since we were only 80 miles away from the North Pole, we
feel that it was justified for us to have called our skiing club the North Pole
Skiing club, right from the beginning. And, until we leave the ship, we will
continue to make our weekly ski tours and push even further North.

Commentator: Some scientists have already been flown from the Dranitsyn to the
Polarstern. Among them is Torsten Kanzow, who will take over the leadership of
the expedition from Christian Haas. During the long outward journey, the new
personnel has had a chance to grow together as a team and prepare itself for
the forthcoming tasks.
 
Torsten Kanzow: I’m Torsten Kanzow. I’m a physical Oceanographer, working at
the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar- and Marine Research and will be taking
over the leadership for the third leg of the expedition.

Torsten Kanzow: We have tried very, very hard to come together as a team. Many
scientists didn’t know each other before they joined the expedition and they
have now got to know each other well and organised themselves to be able to
work together. And we have worked an awful lot within the team. Apart from
preparing themselves for their individual duties, the scientists have tried to
work out different ways for ensuring  effective cooperation between individual
groups within the team. In addition, we indulged in an awful lot of free time
activities together. We met for communal film evenings, had a table tennis
tournament, and quiz evenings. There was frequently a presentation of the best
photographs of the day. There were many, many activities, some on deck as well.
I believe we used the outward journey and the leg very well to become a team.

Torsten Kanzow: But on the way here, when the progress through the ice wasn’t
so great we went through a roller-coaster of emotions. During the last few days
we have been progressing much faster and the mood depended very, very  strongly
upon how high we rated the chances that we would be able to reach the
Polarstern. From time to time we discussed other alternative possibilities of
how we could accomplish our mission, if the Dranitsyn couldn’t get to the
Polarstern. So naturally for a long time, and indeed still even today, because
the Dranitsyn isn’t there yet, she is still 30 miles distant, we have been
holding our breath. [Ed.: in the meantime, the leg3 people can breathe out. The
Dranitsyn made it the next day 28. February] But with the good progress that we
made during the final part of the trip, its only natural that there are many
more happy and hopeful faces to be seen. 

Commentator: The next thing that must be done is to coordinate the mooring of
the two ships so that people and materials can be exchanged. The captain of
the  Dranitsyn has received  a comprehensive plan for this.  Torsten Kanzow is
very happy about the next leg but also has very high expectations for the next
few months.

Torsten Kanzow: On the Dranitsyn we received the plans from Captain Stefan
Schwarze, that the mooring of the two ships should be different from the last
time.  The mooring position of the Dranitsyn should be about a kilometre away
from the Polarstern, to the East. There, as I understand it, there are some
sort of infrastructural measures being made to ensure that the transfer of
goods from the Dranitsyn to the Polarstern can take place over the ice floe.
Naturally we are very happy about this, because it will allow us to kick off
with our activities on the ice floe. The third leg can begin or continue
activities, because as I have been told it has  now officially started.  Our
expectations are very, very  high, in the main because the team seems to me to
very motivated and friendly. That’s… That gives me good reason to anticipate
that we will be able to achieve a lot, both by carrying on with MOSAiC’s
successful projects  and by complementing them through starting new ones.
Naturally some of this expectancy is bound up with the fact that we will
experience the transition from darkness to 100 percent daylight.  That makes
our leg a really, really special one – although of course the other legs were
too, in their own way – and that understandably gives this leg  its own
powerful allure. Today, on the flight here, we could get our first impression
of what we are about to experience: the ascending sun was already producing a
red twilit sky and I have to say that it made the flight breath-taking. The
helicopter trip today was quite an amazing experience.

Commentator: How successful the changeover from leg 2 to leg 3 will turn out to
be and whether the expectations of the new expedition leader Torsten Kanzow
will be fulfilled, you can find out by listening to the next instalment of
Arctic Drift – the audio logbook.

    5. Heated operation mode
    Theory of operation
    The novel feature of this new IMB buoy is the development of chains that
    can be operated in what can be described as either a ‘‘hot-wire
    anemometer’’ mode or a needle-probe thermal conductivity mode. Hot-wire
    anemometry is a standard technique in experimental fluid dynamics and has
    been widely described (e.g., Perry 1982;La Barbara and Vogel 1976).
    Essentially a temperature-sensing element in a moving fluid is heated to
    above ambient temperature, and the amount of heat required to maintain a
    constant sensor temperature is measured. The amount of heat required
    depends on both the thermal characteristics of the surrounding fluid and
    its flow velocity. In principle, the output of the Maxim DS28EA00sensor
    device can be refined for the estimation of both these quantities, thus
    allowing determination of the position of the ice–air–water interfaces and
    quantification of flow speeds. The sensitivity of the present design is not
    yet capable of the quantification of flow speeds

Here looking at T56 heat files in the hope they might offer an easy route to
calculating and displaying ice thickness but although there is a 'heat'
difference between air, snow, ice and water, it doesn't appear to offer an easy
advantage over the standard temperature measurement at 30s. At 120s heating
(shown below) the difference is clearer but still requires interpretation.
Initial impressions are that HEAT120 indicates that the snow layer may be
deeper than that indicated by the temperature gradient change. (Not much in it
though)
edit:  t looks like the interfaces between air, snow, ice and water are shifted
up the thermistor numbers after 120sec heat, perhaps because heat rises.(Noted
that the two frames are not very well aligned)

T56 Last profiles are available here, colour version here

    There is light! Together with the Kapitan Dranitsyn the twilight has come
    to our ice floe. Since two weeks we experienced so-called nautical
    twilight, and on today's Sunday, there is the onset of civil twilight, when
    the sun is less than six degrees below the horizon. In civil twilight, it
    is possible to read outside and to properly see the surface of the snow and
    ice. This light really makes a difference: We can now see the horizon,
    which appears surprisingly high. Previously our sights were limited to the
    Polarstern's searchlights and the spotlights we had installed on the ice,
    illuminating only a few hundred meters around the vessel. Now our world has
    become really big and our little MOSAiC floe seems to have shrunk to a
    small spot in the ice universe.

Between now and the Equinox. Assuming the PolarStern continues to head south to
88 North by the 13th March, then the 13th March is it ( I think)

From the MOSAIC Blog:

Two New Records at the North Pole

Quote

    Despite adverse ice conditions, resupply icebreaker reaches the MOSAiC
    expedition
    [02. March 2020]
    For days, fast sea ice had slowed the progress of the resupply icebreaker
    Kapitan Dranitsyn; bound for the North Pole, her mission was to support the
    second exchange of researchers and crew in the MOSAiC expedition.
    Nevertheless, she steadily drew closer to her destination, and finally, at
    12:20 pm (CET) on Friday, 28 February, dropped anchor 970 metres from
    Polarstern, moored to the same floe. While the handover is in full swing on
    the MOSAiC floe, in Russia another icebreaker will soon leave port in order
    to supply Kapitan Dranitsyn with additional fuel on her return trip

Perhaps it was something lost in translation but I'm wondering what is implied
by "fast sea ice" in the above paragraph ?

From NSIDC definition. Fast Ice : "ice that is anchored to the shore or ocean
bottom, typically over shallow ocean shelves at continental margins; fast ice
is defined by the fact that it does not move with the winds or currents".

The ice is drifting, as illustrated so often in this thread.

Are they referring to the general "pack ice" ?

Maybe that is what is meant.  The english term for that would be "drift ice".
Fast ice is the opposite ie not moving/drifting. It was probably just an
unfortunate choice of words with fast sea ice referring to fast moving as
opposed to fast ice ie static !

Fast ice is usually coloured grey on the colour ice charts. Here is a typical
one from Norwegian Met.

Fast ice is evident sticking out from the islands of Svalbard and the red is
the drift ice.

Reading more of the text, it sounds like it is the ice ridges and hummocks that
were causing problems to the ice breaker. (some 20m high).

The original German article says "festes Meereis".  I think what they mean in
this context is compact sea ice.

    Welp, an immense crack developed in the near vicinity.


Today they report on the event on the web app:

Quote

    A large lead of more than 5 km length and 500 m width opened north east of
    Polarstern in a distance of about 1 nautical mile. Leads are very important
    for the winter Arctic energy balance and biogeochemistry. Hence, 6
    scientists from team ATMOS and BGC, set out to scout the way for future
    instrument deployment and take some samples on the spot. Once we got near
    the location of the lead, we were stopped by high and rugged ridges. But
    luckily, a smaller lead had formed just there. In addition to taking snow
    and ice samples, we also discovered icicles under the blocks of sea ice
    that had been lifted (see picture). That was an unexpected sampling
    opportunity to understand the chemical budget of the wintertime Arctic that
    we could not let pass. A couple of hours later, we saw from the ship radar
    images that the formerly impressive lead is closing again.

The good people at meereisportal.de have got the buoy updates working again.
With the present wind forecast it would be informative to see how the mosaic
project begins to approach land. So the buoy animations have to go back to
0°Longitude down to show the Plot Svalbard map. Svalbard/FJL gap bottom right.

A somewhat interesting article about the resupply of the Polarstern (it's the
second of two articles on this page):

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/climate/
nyt-climate-newsletter-coronavirus.html

This is the intro from the article:

Here’s the good news: A Russian icebreaker on a voyage to resupply a climate
change research expedition barely 100 miles from the North Pole finally reached
its destination after struggling through heavy ice for weeks.

Here’s the bad: The ship, Kapitan Dranitsyn, burned so much fuel that now it,
too, has to be resupplied. Another icebreaker is on its way to bring it more
fuel.

Such are the logistical complexities of the expedition, known as Mosaic, in
which a German research ship, Polarstern, has been drifting with the sea ice in
the Arctic Ocean since October with a revolving complement of scientists. The
ship is expected to come out of the ice east of Greenland in September after
gathering a year’s worth of data on conditions in the remote Central Arctic.

Coronavirus crisis hits ice-locked Arctic research expedition

...

The mission, called MOSAiC, is operating from the German research vessel
Polarstern, which has been intentionally frozen in Arctic sea ice since last
October. From this ice-encrusted platform, a rotating cast of scientists and
technicians are sampling the ice, atmosphere and ocean in an attempt to
understand the intricacies of the rapidly changing Arctic climate.

The team member who contracted the virus works on the airborne component of the
expedition — a key part that has now been delayed to protect those on board the
ship. This part of the mission will use scientific aircraft to take
measurements around Polarstern to provide context for those taken at the ship.

About 20 members of the aircraft team are now quarantined in their homes under
direction of the German health agencies, says Markus Rex, an atmospheric
scientist at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in
Bremerhaven, Germany. Rex is the chief scientist of the MOSAiC mission.

...

Close quarters
To minimize the risk of exposure to the coronavirus, all team members who are
scheduled to join MOSAiC — which stands for Multidisciplinary Drifting
Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate — are tested for coronavirus before
departing their homes for Svalbard, Norway, from where they leave for the ship.
There, they are tested a second time before they are allowed to depart. The
infected individual had been at a workshop in Bremerhaven on 5 March with other
aircraft members; the first round of testing was done as part of this meeting.

The headline is a bit misleading but this is another complication.

I'm surprised that this expedition did not plan to be able to go without
significant resupply for longer than a few months.
Even the catastrophic final Franklin expedition planned to be able to live
fairly well for 3 years and survive for 7 years.

    The start of the MOSAiC flight campaign, a scientific aircraft operation,
    is postponed due to a COVID-19 case. The positively-tested person was a
    participant of a preparation course in Bremerhaven.

    All MOSAiC participants will be tested for corona before departure to
    minimize the risk of infections on board.

    Our virus safety concept, which includes double testing of all participants
    before the start of any operation, proved to be effective. Other elements
    of MOSAiC are not affected, the virus has not reached the expedition.

    We are closely working with the German Health Agency, which is in charge of
    defining the details of the quarantine for the affected persons. Also we
    are closely monitoring the global virus situation and will adapt our safety
    concept to the evolving situation if needed.

    It is our highest priority to (1) prevent importing the virus into the
    expedition and also (2) to avoid spreading the virus around the globe. This
    is why we only allow tested people to travel for MOSAiC.

    Contrary to misleading media reports, there is no infection onboard
    Polarstern.

From the web app:

Quote

    On Wednesday we were once again reminded that we are surrounded by dynamic
    sea ice. Small cracks appeared around the ship in the morning and widened
    during the day. In the early evening, these small cracks had developed into
    leads reaching a width of up to 10 metres. We are extremely lucky that none
    of the cracks pass directly through any of our research cities. However,
    part of the floe is now inaccessible. To avoid further damage, the power
    and data connection for Met City (and also Remote Sensing City) were shut
    down promptly. With assistance from the helicopter it was possible to
    access the other side of the lead in order to save precarious scientific
    equipment from the lead's edge. Fortunately, it was possible to provide
    power to some of the instruments using external generators. Overnight, the
    leads stayed open and were filled with new ice and snow. On Thursday, the
    generators were refueled and the rescue operations of further instruments
    within Met City continued. Now, we cross our fingers for an improvement in
    the weather. The stationary low-pressure system above us is producing wind
    speeds up to 20 m/s - and therefore the movement within and around our ice
    floe is not yet over. Thus, we exercise further patience until we can
    return our instruments and continue our measurements on site.

Via the AWI blog:

MOSAiC aerial survey campaigns for the atmosphere and sea ice temporarily
suspended

Quote

    On Thursday 12 March, the Norwegian government announced comprehensive
    measures to combat the spread of the corona virus, effective immediately.
    As a result, all travellers to Norway from non-Nordic countries who do not
    have a residence permit will most likely have to immediately leave the
    country again or be placed in quarantine for 14 days. In response, and due
    to the highly dynamic development of the corona pandemic, on Friday 13
    March the MOSAiC project management decided to temporarily suspend the
    aerial survey campaigns planned for this spring and based in the Svalbard
    archipelago, which is under Norwegian administration. There are currently
    three icebreakers underway in the Central Arctic for the MOSAiC expedition.

As mentioned in the AWI blog post:

Quote

    Icebreaker rendezvous in the Arctic ice: The Kapitan Dranitsyn fert the
    MOSAiC ice floe with the team of leg 2 on 4 March and met Admiral Makarov
    at 84°48' North and 42°35' East on Saturday, 14 March. This additional
    icebreaker from Russia had left to supply the Kapitan Dranitsyn with fuel
    after her long journey through the Arctic ice. Shortly after they had met,
    the two ships began docking maneuvers. Refuelling takes about 2 to 3 days
    after which Kapitan Dranitsyn can continue her journey towards Tromso. We
    expect the team of leg 2 back in Tromso in the second half of March
    depending On sea ice and weather conditions. The families and colleagues
    ashore are already looking forward to welcoming the researchers and crew
    members of leg 2 back home!

If you don't usually visit the MOSAIC web app, do it today.

They have a hi-res aerial image of the floe. You can zoom in.

The fortress is completely in scrambles. :'(

Not seen anything recently from A-team, was wondering about the current
position of the Polarstern, since there seems to be a strong flow out of the
Fram it would seem that the expedition might leave the ice sooner than they
expected?

Here is an English language transcript of the podcast called "Arctic Drift"
from the MOSAiC website that is otherwise only available in German. It was
posted there on 21. March but it the "now" it refers to was probably sometime
in the week of the 15th March, when the Polarstern was drifting South rather
rapidly.

MOSAIC_AUDIOLOGBOOK14



Commentator Audio Now.....The  Audio-Logbook.

Torsten Kanzow:  my name is Torsten Kanzow: and I’m leader of the third leg of
MOSAiC. I’m a physical oceanographer and work at the Alfred-Wegener-Institute
for Polar- and Ocean- Research.

Commentator: In the meantime, the crew of the third leg of the MOSAiC
expedition has reached the Icebreaker Polarstern and is already continuing
scientific work. The expedition leader Torsten Kanzow and his team had to
endure a journey there that was not only a very arduous and challenging, but
also took much longer than originally planned.
 
Torsten Kanzow: we successfully completed the journey here to the MOSAiC ice
floe, to the Polarstern, on board a Russian icebreaker the Captain Dranitsyn,
and the journey from Tromsø up to 88 degrees North, almost to the North Pole 
 took a total of four weeks. And I would say it featured a number of
challenges.  Immediately after our departure from Tromsø on 27. January we
anchored in a neighbouring fjord for the first four or five days because we had
to weather the bad conditions on the open ocean and could only continue when
they’d passed. We reached the edge of the ice in the Barents sea relatively
quickly
but then we suffered an excruciating slow passage through the ice that lasted
for several weeks and during that time it wasn’t really predictable how long it
would take until we reached the ice floe. We tried to maintain a  lot of
contact with the Alfred-Wegener-Institute, that was closely following what we
were doing. At some stage we realised that to some extent  it was going to be a
battle with the fuel reserves of the Dranitsyn, so that at some point different
options as to how we could manage the exchange with the participants of the
previous leg were brought up. There was lots of discussion about whether
perhaps helicopters could succeed in bridging the distance between the
Dranitsyn and the Polarstern for the last part of the trip or whether the
journey time of the Dranitsyn should be extended, and in the end the last
variant was chosen. This was because what our home base in Bremerhaven was able
to organise was that, in effect, another icebreaker would set off to sail in
the direction of the Dranitsyn, to meet her in the ice  as she was returning to
Tromsø after  having brought us to the floe, and refuel her. 

Torsten Kanzow: we actually arrived at the floe at the beginning of March, when
the conditions had already changed so that we could see the first light of the
Arctic dawn, whereas during the whole journey there we’d been in complete
darkness, and so I think naturally we were very, very  relieved when we finally
arrived. This is because for many of the expedition’s participants it was of
decisive importance to be able to set up their experiments and do on site
research. After months and in some cases years of preparation for many of us it
would have been very, very distressing and shattering if we hadn’t managed to
get here. So, we were very, very glad when we covered the last miles and were
able to moor on the MOSAiC floe.

Commentator: after the long and gruelling trip, even before he arrived at
Polarstern itself, the new expedition leader was rewarded with a visual treat.

Torsten Kanzow: as soon as we came within range of  the helicopter, it was
already the case for me that I was flown to the Polarstern as part of the
vanguard from the Dranitsyn, so to speak, to arrange details of the exchange
between the participants of the second and third legs. What that meant was that
the vanguard was able to actually observe the observatory from the air and that
on a very, very beautiful day on which the dawn light could be clearly seen for
the first time.  It was an absolutely breath-taking flight and an awesome
sight. Then at the first opportunity after I landed,  I looked out of the
window of the Polarstern at the observatory and it was of course totally,
totally different to just looking at something I had, till then, only known
from pictures. Then came the realisation that I was there at last and that all
that travelling had been worth it.

Torsten Kanzow: as it happened, I went to the Ocean-City on the day of my
arrival. My colleagues, whom I know from the Alfred-Wegener-Institute had
invited me there. In the  Ocean-City measurements of the ocean are being made,
mainly physical measurements, but water samples are also being taken. My
colleagues are active there almost every single day and what it involves is a
small tent that has been placed on pontoons on the ice and, in the middle of
the tent there is a hole through the ice, so that you can see through the sea
ice down to the water. Measuring instruments are put into the water, through
this hole, to allow measurements and samples to be made at depths of up to 4000
metres.

Commentator: The handover of the scientific monitoring stations on the ice floe
took several days and was hampered the extreme temperatures there. After
successful completion of the handover the new team of leg three is
correspondingly relieved and motivated to be able to finally get on with their
real work.

Torsten Kanzow: It was a phase during which we had extremely low temperatures.
We had temperatures of around minus 40. We had good visibility, but it was
very, very cold. At such cold temperatures the mechanical devices on the ships
and all the mechanical devices that are required to move freight from one ship
to other are naturally operating at the limit of their capabilities.  The
hydraulic systems of the cranes were not operating well. In addition, we had
the situation that  the Dranitsyn wasn’t moored directly next to the
Polarstern, but a kilometre away on the same floe. This was done on purpose to
hinder any destruction of the ice in the vicinity of the Polarstern as a result
of the arrival of the Dranitsyn. So, our colleagues prepared a sort of small
road on the ice floe.   A path on the ice was cleared and for the first couple
of days  the exchange of materials and personnel was really rather sluggish,
because of the problems that I’ve just mentioned, but then things improved as
the handling of the individual pieces of equipment could be, so to speak,
better adapted to the conditions. And so, after five or six says we were
through with the exchange and hadn’t just transferred all the freight from the
Dranitsyn to the Polarstern, but also all the personnel, who were conveyed from
one ship to the other on sleds. This was a phase during which, at the same
time, the scientists from the second leg had to hand over and explain the use
experimental equipment and sensors. It was a very, very intense period. But I
believe that I, and everyone else who participated, was very glad when it ended
and one could get cracking on one’s own.  We all appreciated it a lot to have
the floe in our hands, so to speak, and to get to work as individual teams.

Commentator: Despite this, even for Kanzow and his team, the new surroundings
are still very unfamiliar and so even after the first few days he still doesn’t
feel quite at home.

Torsten Kanzow: I believe that that takes just a little more time. I haven’t
yet inspected everything. Naturally, to begin with, we were faced with the
challenge of familiarising ourselves with everything and setting up our daily
routines, and then getting on with our projects. I was very strongly involved
in events here on board and couldn’t be out in the field as often as many of my
colleagues. I hope that that will now soon change. In particular, its
self-explanatory that we don’t just have to keep the scientific side of things
going, but we must also be logistically in the position to service and maintain
our infrastructure to ensure that we can always be reached, especially by air.
I am already active in this respect and am trying to fulfil this part of my
responsibilities

Commentator: Since a few days after the arrival of the first scientists of leg
one in September the sun hasn’t risen above the horizon. The polar night is now
coming to an end. During the last week it’s gradually been getting lighter and
the first sunrise can be seen.

Torsten Kanzow:  We would have been really happy to happy to experience the
moment of seeing the sun for the first time, but today we didn’t see it. It
wasn’t visible for the whole day, because we have had very, very strong winds
here, bad visibility and to some extent low cloud. So today wasn’t much
different from the day before. It was an exciting day, because our position
shifted quite a lot and we were kept very busy organising how we could protect
certain pieces of equipment from cracks in the ice. It began yesterday and has
continued till now. That meant that we had a lot of practical worries to deal
with rather than concerning ourselves about the sun. However, a celebration
party is planned to welcome the sun. We still have to decide on the day,
because at the moment the weather  really isn’t good enough for grilling
outside. 

Commentator: Because of the extreme conditions in the Arctic, both the
scientists and the technical staff are continually confronted with new
challenges. The new expedition leader is particularly impressed by the tireless
efforts of the logistics team.

Torsten Kanzow: When we arrived on the floe, a fleet of various vehicles was
handed over to us. We could move around on the floe with them or use them, for
instance to prepare a landing strip. It included  2 Pisten-Bullis and 8
Skidoos. But then within a few days, because of the extremely low temperatures
and other technical defects we were only in a position to start 3 of the
Skidoos and neither of the Pisten-Bullis could be used.  That meant that we
were able to see with our own eyes how quickly the technical requirements, that
are a prerequisite for working in the field here, can become shaken or even be
forgone as the result of extremes of temperature and other technical
difficulties.  What particularly impresses me was how the people here are
applying themselves to getting all our equipment back into working order under
these extreme conditions. Motors are being dismantled and parts removed, fuel
lines cleaned and other diverse operations carried out at temperatures of minus
30 or minus 40. So, by now we already have 7 of the skidoos up and running  and
today both Pisten-Bullis were running again. That naturally requires  the
logistics people to invest a lot of energy in keeping us fully operational.

Commentator: Apart from the scientific projects the handover to the crew of the
next leg must also be planned. This is should or rather must take place by air.
The existing airstrip must be modified for this.

Torsten Kanzow: Until now, one of the foci of my work was to try and find and
survey a site that would be suitable for a landing strip. This is because the
exchange of the next cohort of scientists at the beginning of April should be
taking place by air. That’s something to which we must give priority. We do
have a landing strip already, but it’s not suitable for the type of aircraft
that we are planning to deploy for the exchange. So we’re working on an
alternative, but very recently the conditions changed rather abruptly as a
result of the mobility of the ice, through cracks and leads that have appeared
in the ice. I believe that we now have to work in parallel to ensure that
working conditions on the ice remain safe. That must certainly be a focus that
is assured or to see, after the storm that we are currently experiencing has
ended, how we are still able to get to our measuring equipment.  How can we
make sure that it‘s possible to carry on working safely? I think that’s one
focus and another one is to work on the options for the landing strip. A third
focus, that I am attempting to set up scientifically, is to enable physical
oceanographic measurements to be carried out. Together with other scientists we
are developing an experiment to understand the processes that go on in these
areas of open water that appear as the result of cracks and leads opening and
that are in direct contact with the atmosphere. That’s a situation that
interests many of us here. It’s a situation in which a lot of  oceanic heat is
released into the atmosphere, and that affects the ocean, which cools as the
result of sea ice being formed, while on the other hand, how can I say it,  the
atmosphere gets a source of energy that can drive atmospheric circulation.
That’s where we are at the moment, scientifically preparing things somewhat and
it’s a theme that will keep me occupied in the coming weeks.

    Anybody got a good link for up to date reasonably accurate PolarStern
    location.

mmtest files here have PS location to 2dp but are updated infrequently.

or there are nearby buoys

    The web app has it, Gero.

    https://follow.mosaic-expedition.org

Found lots of pretty maps but nowhere the Lat Long coordinates. Makes it a pain
to plug it into Nullschool.

I used to bemoan how most of the world was losing the ability to do
mathematics,
Then I used to bemoan how most of the world was losing the ability to do simple
arithmetic,

But now for most of the world even numbers seem to be redundant.

It's on the Mosaic website in the little daily report in the bottom right hand
corner.
Sailwx also reports sporadically with the Polarstern callsign DBLK and when it
does the values correspond.
You will also find it in the upper left hand corner of Polarstern position
grapfic on the start page of the Uni Bremen Sea Ice webpage https://
seaice.uni-bremen.de/start/(always gives position at 03.00 UTC).
I hope this helps

Ohboiohboi! All scrambles...

Quote

    Even after two weeks, the dynamics of our floe do not calm down. Our ice
    floe with initially a diameter of several kilometers is getting smaller and
    smaller as a consequence of natural forces. Tides in the ocean and strong
    winds in the atmosphere are pushing the floe. At the same time and due to
    the same forces, the leads around us give space when the ice is relaxing
    again. These ongoing dynamics keep our personal tensions up: How will the
    floe look like tomorrow morning? Can we work on the ice? Which
    installations on the ice might need to be rescued? Can we use the powerline
    between the ship and the ice floe? Over the last days, the latter was not
    always the case as the ship was simply moving too much. Also, small "island
    states" that are not accessible by foot have formed. However, using the
    helicopters on board, allows to continue our measurements in these outposts
    with limitations. The expedition name "MOSAiC" says it all!

Yes, 6 more Pbuoys (I think I can count 7, or maybe they are a different
batch). Should give us a good idea of drift into the fram. Not much snow in
that image.

Today's S1B showing how fractured the area further north east is. PS could be a
lot worse off.

An estimate of sea ice thickness based on data from mosaic Thermistor Buoys ,
mar1-apr6 with a lot of help from SimonF92. We have also estimated snow
thickness though identifying it accurately has proved problematic.
Full details of the methods attempted can be found here Comments on the methods
or initial analysis of other mosaic buoy data are most welcome on that thread

    Thanks to the support of the German research vessels Merian and Sonne, the
    MOSAiC expedition will continue, despite the coronavirus pandemic. The new
    MOSAiC team will start in May.

Here's an English language transcript of the Audiologbook of the Polarstern
from the MOSAiC expedition website that is otherwise only available in German.
It was posted last Thursday (23. April). In the meantime we know that  the
Polarstern is going to move from its current floe to go to Svalbard to meet 2
German  support vessels to get supplies and to change the scientific personnel.
Whether it will return to the position it had left or reposition itself on
another floe further North still hadn't been decided at the time of making this
post.

MOSAIC_AUDIOLOGBOOK15

Commentator:  The crew of the third leg of the MOSAiC Expedition directed  by
Expedition leader Thorsten Kanzow has now been on the icebreaker Polarstern for
more than a month and a half. In the meantime, polar day prevails: the sun
doesn’t disappear behind the horizon anymore and makes the work of the
scientists a little more pleasant. At the same time, the ice is, as before,
always in motion resulting in continual changes.

Thorsten Kanzow: One thing that I find very impressive is, I‘m searching for a
word, is the dynamic change that one sees here on the floe. What I’m trying to
express is what one experiences when one goes to the bridge in the morning and
sees how pieces of the floe or the cities or other markers on the ice have
shifted and moved in relation to each other.  What we now realise is that it’s
often the same leads that open and close again and again, the same fracture
lines that exist in the ice so that such a large stable vessel like the
Polarstern is unable to withstand the forces at work to keep itself stably
positioned in the ice, and we experience these forces at first hand. I find
that very, very striking. This observation may not be the result of a single
experiment or from one particular group, but its something that affects all the
groups in the course of their daily work.

Commentator: The continual movement of the ice makes the scientific work on the
floe difficult. Some areas of the camp can temporarily only be reached with
difficulty or may even be totally cut off. This results in experiments having
to be set up all over again and limits the measurements that can carried out. 

Thorsten Kanzow: So, the MOSAiC floe has experienced several changes. When we
arrived here it was very, very cold. It was also dark most of the time and the
floe was, for the most part, intact. That meant that we were able to get to all
the scientific monitoring stations and the automated monitoring in the various
cities was going well. Then came a phase from circa the 11th of March onward
when there was a lot of ice movement and an increased number of leads  opened
up in the ice and then closed up again resulting in ice ridges piling up where
they joined up again. This led to us often having to cut the electrical power
supply to the monitoring stations that we could not reach, or could  only reach
with difficulty. And I think we suffered  substantially during this period.
During the last week or two the situation here on the floe has become very
quiet or at least quieter. The ice has compacted considerably and that means
that many of the activities that were either partially stopped, or that had to
stopped completely, have been restarted. Some of the monitoring stations have
been reconstructed or reconfigured and located nearer to the ship. But I would
say that, in principle, at the moment we are gathering a lot of data.

Commentator: The scientists are able to react very flexibly to these changes.
They have been able to make use of the situation and gather data about it from
various different scientific angles. For example, it was possible for them to
gather a lot of data about lead opening and ice ridge formation. 

Thorsten Kanzow: We have, of course, invested a lot of time and effort into
investigating these changes, in particular into the opening of leads. Indeed,
the phenomena of lead opening and the subsequent piling up of ice to form ice
ridges are connected. We have worked a lot on this phenomenon, not only from
the aspect of sea ice but also from an atmospheric and oceanographic
perspective. That has been one focus of the change in the science.  A second
change is related to the fact that we have daylight back again: there is
sunlight all day and the sun does not set. For instance, one consequence of
this is that  a number of chemical processes in the atmosphere change and that
a number of important biological processes that take place in the floe have
begun. Scientifically speaking, those are two big changes we have experienced
on the floe.

Commentator: Other than originally planned, the drift of the ship and the floe
have clearly shifted further in a southerly direction. This will affect the
scientific work, because among other  factors the water in this region has
different properties.

Thorsten Kanzow: For example, when we look at the ocean then we find ourselves
moving through  another body of water either than when the expedition started
or at the beginning of our leg of the expedition. We are now in so-called
Atlantic water. This is a very, very salt-laden body of water. That means that
simply as a result of the Atlantic influx, the water with which the floe  makes
contact has become much more salty. That in turn has an effect on  the biology
of the floe, on the supply of nutrients. In addition, and one has to speculate
a little here, the speed with which we have advanced southwards  is coupled to
the risk that we could possibly enter a zone in which the ice will break up
still further. A zone in which we could get very, very strong lead formation
and that would then alter and limit the work we do, but could also possibly
present us with new opportunities.

Commentator: After completing many arduous tasks during the last few weeks, 
the scientists now have a little more time for social contact on the ship. It
is not always that easy to find the right balance between work and private
life.
 
Thorsten Kanzow: I think that we were able to get to know one another very well
on the journey here on the Dranitsyn from Tromsø to the ice floe. That was, of
course, a period in which we were not so immersed in work. Then came a period
during which we had to work extremely hard and social life had to take a
backseat. But I think that, at the moment, its recovering. For example, over
Easter we did a lot of things together. We had an evening gathering on the ice
with the Easter fire in little bowls and on Easter Sunday we had a barbecue
with a party afterwards party on the ice. Those are proper events and just this
very minute, as we are speaking, a football match is taking place on the ice.
This means that one can  see that social activities are recovering. Activities
are also offered that involve both scientists and crew, such as regular
excursions on the ice, but there are also activities that take place on board
like table tennis tournaments and things like that.

Commentator: The polar day that has meanwhile arrived also contributes to the
wellbeing of all on board.

Thorsten Kanzow: I’ve already been in the arctic in summer. That means a lot of
light and that the light doesn’t  go away, because it is light twenty-four
hours a day, even at midnight. That I have already experienced. The alternative
scenario was not something I was familiar with. This means that the complete
darkness that we experienced on the Dranitsyn, was the first time I was able to
experience it so intensely. I must say that I much prefer the scenario with
light to the one without. I think it is quite easy to retire in the evening and
to be able to darken your room, but to have to go completely without light I
don’t find at all pleasant.

Commentator: Acoustically one is continually made aware dynamic nature of the
ice surrounding the Polarstern: time and again the pressure of the ice makes
the ship vibrate  and that impresses even the most experienced  scientists.

Thorsten Kanzow: These noises are connected with the movements of the ship.
When they occur I am always gripped by a  slight fear and I go to the bridge to
see how our power lines are faring - the lines that go from the ship onto the
floe and then to the various places where power is needed all the time. And the
other priority that I feel I must control, because of the safety aspect,  is
whether the gangway is still securely positioned at the place where the
scientific personnel go onto the ice or come back from it. Otherwise I have to
say that it’s a crazy phenomenon, to be able to experience how the ice ridges
pile up to the stern of the ship and tear out the ice anchor  and break cables
as their formation progresses. I must say it’s rather impressive.

Commentator: The changes in the ice and especially these consequences of the
ice movements are not predictable. Should the temperature rise further in the
next few days and weeks as a result of persistent warm air, then further
impacts on scientific work are to be expected.

Thorsten Kanzow: If it [the warm air] is an occurrence that only lasts for a
few days and then everything returns to normal, then I think big changes will
only come later. But, at the moment, we don’t know whether we will experience
this rebound within the next four or five days so we can’t plan ahead. And what
if that does not happen? We still have southerly winds, that means winds that
are bringing warm air masses here. I think that if this warm air occurrence
caries  on for one or two weeks then this is going to have a lot of
consequences for the science, for the biosphere and for the properties of the
sea ice, possibly even on the heat uptake by the ocean and so on. This means
that the processes that connect the ocean, the ice and the atmosphere would all
change and if that carries on for long  it will result in large scale
consequences.

Commentator: Are there any wishes both from both a scientific and a personal
perspective for the remaining weeks that the team of the third leg is going
stay on the Polarstern?

Thorsten Kanzow: from a scientific perspective, I hope that that now that we
have managed to get lots of things running that were temporarily experiencing
difficulties, I really hope that we will be able to maintain this status for
the next two or three weeks. But since the science is also changing, I hope
that the teams will also be able to record all the changes too, because after
all that’s what we are here for. We didn’t come here only at a particular time
of year with a certain general weather situation because we wanted to
investigate a single season, rather we wanted to follow  the transitions
between the different seasons. That means that the science that one does has to
change too. However, with limited manpower and with the teams working to nearly
full capacity on the scientific tasks they have already set themselves that is
difficult to achieve. However, the teams are working very, very strongly
together with the experts at their home bases to find the right balance between
continuing existing programmes and trying to answer new scientific questions
and  setting up new experiments. And that, from a scientific perspective,  is
my biggest wish: that they will succeed.  As expedition leader I naturally also
want the scientists to be cheerful and content and to get on well with each
other, as indeed they have so far. From a personal perspective, I want to
continue to hear good news from home.

Most Thermistor buoys are showing a slow down in ice thickening as temperatures
have risen. click to run SimonF92's animation above.
T72 is discussed here
T62 is also showing a small reduction in thickness. The animation below shows
temperatures from apr1-28, looking at near surface temperatures, the
temperature gradient from surface to ocean and near ocean temperatures. Bottom
freezing continues through most of april, surface activity is more difficult to
interpret.
The second animation is a drift update using p201, p204 and p207. Retracing
north east with the southerly winds.

Interesting Fomo yesterday suggesting vertical mixing in the upper 70m of the
ocean due to strong winds. Guessing this is turbulence from ice keels since the
wind has little direct access to the ocean.

Following up on vertical mixing, here we look at whoi itp94 which is within the
mosaic buoy array, last position reported yesterday at 84.0238° N, 16.527° E.
On the left are temperature and salinity from 7m-70m, on the right from 7-200m,
both from oct2019 to apr26, the last full profile to 200m.
I'm not sure how the charts relate to any recent weather mentioned by the fomo
diary entry but it's easy to see a more atlantic profile developing over time

Oh noes! :(

Coronavirus shutdown forces research ship to break out of Arctic ice

Quote

    MOSAiC mission will return to its frozen-in platform, but disruption caused
    by team changeover will create a gap in its unique climate data set.

    When scientists were planning MOSAiC — an epic research expedition that
    would remain trapped in Arctic sea ice for one year — they considered the
    North Pole’s hazards. They worried about hypothermia, isolation, crushing
    ice and polar bears. They had dozens of contingency plans. But no one
    anticipated a pandemic.

    The travel restrictions and flight cancellations imposed because of the
    coronavirus outbreak have now forced mission planners to make a seemingly
    impossible decision. Polarstern, the German research vessel central to the
    expedition, will temporarily leave its position in the ice to exchange its
    crew, and so will be forced to abandon the research camp where it has been
    frozen since October.

    The disruption is a blow to the mission’s researchers, who have created a
    unique platform from which to study climate change in the Arctic, with a
    data due to be collected continuously over an entire year. Although they
    hope to refreeze the ship at the same camp after a three-week pause, the
    interruption will leave a hefty gap in the data set — and potentially miss
    a crucial time for data collection as Arctic ice begins its springtime
    melt.

    “Ideally, we would not leave the ice — but given all the circumstances, I
    think it’s amazing we were able to come up with a solution to continue the
    experiment,” says Donald Perovich, a geophysicist at Dartmouth College in
    Hanover, New Hampshire, and a member of MOSAiC’s project board.

    Close quarters
    The news will come as a relief to the scientists and crew who have had to
    grapple with the uncertainty of having no return date. The travel stoppages
    have left the crew stranded since early April, when flights in and out of
    the Norwegian islands of Svalbard were meant to have swapped the ship’s
    researchers. “That put them in a much more difficult place
    psychologically,” says Allison Fong, a polar biologist at the Alfred
    Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany, and a co-leader of MOSAiC’s
    ecosystem team.

    So MOSAiC coordinators have been working tirelessly to find an alternative
    plan. But because the coronavirus pandemic has forced airports, military
    facilities and seaports worldwide to shut down, it has not been easy. The
    only solution requires Polarstern to fire its engines, break free from the
    ice and travel to a fjord in Svalbard. There, it will rendezvous with two
    other ships to swap scientists before returning to the Arctic research camp
    in roughly three weeks. (That timeline could change depending on the
    weather and ice conditions.)

A large animation of S1B images showing PS and surrounding area from apr28-30.
The fracture shown in the bow radar above is not visible at 0751 yesterday but
is open by 0929 (3rd frame).
A much larger lead has opened up to the west, probably easing the tension in
the mosaic area.

the same area today from worldview aqua modis. (medium contrast). The
distinctive opening in the lead makes it easy to identify today.(probably
freshly refrozen)

Perhaps someone would be interested in a daily check on 2020R11 and 2020R12 and
let us know when albedo drops.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo
Quote

    Albedo (/ælˈbiːdoʊ/) (Latin: albedo, meaning 'whiteness') is the measure of
    the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation
    and measured on a scale from 0, corresponding to a black body that absorbs
    all incident radiation, to 1, corresponding to a body that reflects all
    incident radiation.

R11 and R12 are quite close together so probably older snow on R11. Perhaps
wind drove it off.

Are S96 and R11 located very close together ? Co-ords today are same. (to 2
decimal places)

S94 and R12 are also quite close.

R11 has the higher lower albedo. The data for corresponding nearest Snow Buoy
(S96) says "distance to initial snow/ice interface" as 0.024

R12 has higher albedo. Nearest Snow Buoy (S94) has "distance to initial snow/
ice interface" much higher at 0.38.

Could R12 be protruding well above the surface and R11 practically on the
surface ?

From the Norwegian Meteorological Institute:

Strong sea-ice drift for MOSAiC in 2020
https://cryo.met.no/en/mosaic-drift2020

Quote

    Since January, Polarstern has drifted much faster than the ice drifted in
    the previous ten years.

    ...

    The animation shows the trajectory of the MOSAiC drift campaign (red) from
    its beginning in October 2019 and 10 simulated trajectories (other colors)
    from recent years. The drift of Nansen’s Fram from January to April 1896 is

Forecast models are indicating a big storm to move in over Svalbard later
Tuesday.

East or Northeast winds gusting to 90 or 100 km/hr are expected to affect the
area where Polarstern is currently located early Wednesday.

The highest windspeed from the hourly synops reported from Polarstern was 76 km
/hr at 15 UTC on 16th November 2019 with winds from a WSW direction. I wonder
could this be exceeded ?

Incidently atmospheric pressure records reported by the ship since expedition
began were :

lowest pressure : 974 hPa at 16 UTC on 14th March 2020
Highest Pressure : 1034.4 hPa at 10 UTC on 6th December 2019

reverse a couple of times and make a few attempts to bash through !

Yes, it also begins with 3 reverses to break into the lead.
Drift update. Unfortunately it looks like we are saying goodbye to P207 which
stopped sending data 2 days ago. I'll find another Pbuoy close by.

For a while there was a small chance PS would exit between FJL and Svalbard but
an early Fram exit looks highly likely for the buoys now. PS will probably
steam further north, after the Svalbard fjord crew change, to prolong the
expedition.

Polarstern reported a windspeed of 83 km/hr at 3UTC this morning from a NE
direction.

This is the highest windspeed reported by the ship in its hourly synop reports
since the expedition began.

In Beaufort terms it is strong gale force 9.

    and let us know when albedo drops.


Some lower readings at R12 today.

So maybe 20hrs above salt water freezing temps and we get a small albedo drop
(in one location). Thanks.

Since PS is likely to weigh anchors next week, here is a comparison of the floe
from oct8 and today using S1 jp2 from https://www.polarview.aq/arctic

Sonne is the German word for 'sun'.

The Maria S. Merian is named after

    "Maria Sibylla Merian (2 April 1647 – 13 January 1717) [who] was a
    German-born naturalist and scientific illustrator, a descendant of the

Following up on yesterday's fomo:

    Surface classification and melt pond characterization using
    aerialphotography of Arctic sea ice during summer meltNiels Fuchs, Gerit
    Birnbaum, and Wolfgang DierkingAlfred-Wegener-Institut Helmholtz-Zentrum
    für Polar- und Meeresforschung, Climate Sciences, Germany
    (niels.fuchs@awi.de)The surface of the Arctic sea-ice cover changes
    dramatically with the onset of melting: the highly reflective snowcover
    disappears, absorptive melt ponds evolve, and the albedo drops. Images with
    high spatial resolution acquiredwith airborne cameras are an important data
    source to understand this summery sea-ice surface transition. Thedata  is 
    used  as  reference  to  describe  and  evaluate  the  transition  in 
    model  simulations  and  to  develop  retrievalmethods for satellite remote
    sensing products aiming at evaluating the stage of melting.We  use  a 
    comprehensive  airborne  image  data  set,  collected  over  melting  sea 
    ice  in  the  Arctic  since  2008,  tocompile contemporary reference data
    of Arctic sea-ice surface classes during summer melt. To this end, we
    usethe  open  source  sea  ice  classification  algorithm  “OSSP”  (Wright 
    and  Polashenski,  2017,  in  "The  CryosphereDiscussions") with several
    modifications to separate the ice image area into snow covered and bright
    ice, shadowsfrom ridges, wet snow and dark ice, submerged ice and melt
    ponds, and open water. Based on the large data set weobtain statistics of
    surface parameters such as melt pond coverage for first-year ice and
    multi-year ice conditionsat different regions for different melting stages.
    An advantage of our analysis is the use of a constant camera setup.In this
    poster, we give a brief overview about the available data and the OSSP
    algorithm, which is based on asegmentation and random forest classifier
    approach, and present more in detail our modifications of the OSSP,which
    include orthorectification of the image data, changes in the input feature
    list and an improved segmentation.Our primary focus here is a thorough
    study of classification errors for sea ice under melting conditions.
    Further-more, we provide classified images from a 2017 measurement campaign
    north of Svalbard with derived geometricparameters such as, for example,
    melt pond fraction and pond size distribution.


Perhaps we get an example of 'floemosaic' later

From the web-app:

Quote

    Now it is done, team 3 is leaving. The floe is cleanly tidied up and it
    doesn't remind us much of the MOSAiC floe we arrived at over 11
    weeks ago. The floe that was selected as home floe for the MOSAiC
    drift over 7 months ago. A floe that has been explored and sampled
    from all imaginable sides in the last months better than any floe
    ever before. During the last days the ice around us has broken up
    even more. On Tuesday evening we were hit by a strong
    storm with
    wind peaks of more than 9 Bft, and the ice has lived up to the
    project name: A mosaic of
    many cracks has formed around
    Polarstern. Because the storm was well predicted, the important
    and large installations were removed from the ice floe and brought
    to the safety of the ship before. As the ice does not seem safe
    enough at the moment, it was decided to further reduce the
    instruments remaining on the ice during Polarstern's absence. On
    Thursday, our old lady's machines were turned on for this purpose.
    With great sensitivity, the ship was moved to a new parking
    position through the systems of channels in the ice. Thanks to
    countless helping hands on the ice and on the ship, the ice floe was
    then "tidied up" for 1.5 days in sunshine and temperatures around
    freezing point. All that remains on the ice is a variety of
    autonomous measuring systems, which continue to measure above,
    in and under the sea ice, even while Polarstern will not be here for
    the next three weeks. These systems will also help the next
    research team to find our mosaic again. On Saturday at 11 a.m. the
    crane brought the last hard-working helpers back on board - an
    emotional moment for all involved. Afterwards, an area next to the
    floe was washed free of ice for CTD and net work. This work was
    also completed in the evening hours. So our work here is done. We
    say goodbye and now break our way south. Soon team 4 will take
    over our work.

It makes a pretty graph Uniquorn.

I am trying to examine the plot/colours using the right vertical axis.

It looks like brown is predominantly coldest and that corresponds to T21. Then
blue T26 and so on down. I presume the increasing T numbers correspond to
increasing depth ? I wonder do the Tnumbers correspond to cm is that too
simplistic? ie is T121 at depth 121cm ?

Given that T21 or T26 show up on the graph as coldest, where are T1,T6,T11,T16
? I cannot see those colours on the graph but maybe they are all on top of each
other, on top of the T21 brown colour and the brown overshadows these lower
number colours ?

Probably best to download the csv file and view a selection of charts to make a
more detailed analysis but yes the first ~20 thermistors record very similar
temperatures, after which proximity to snow/ice begins to have an effect.
The gradient within the ice is quite smooth but rises quite rapidly with rising
air temperatures.
The snow layer is more difficult to describe.
Thermistors are spaced at 2cm intervals

Graph above is a static way of looking at the animation below.
Air on the left, ocean on the right.

No updates on sailwx for PS, Sonne or MSM today. No S1 yesterday [DEL:or today
so far.:DEL]
We do have an overview of ship positions from uni-Bremen/AWI

Today's S1. The Central Observatory (mosaic floe) top left, PS bottom right.

Really good shot from S1 today showing the old mosaic floe (central
observatory?) top left, PS roughly 1/5th left (bright dot) and how far they
have to go to reach open water (right). It's still possible to make out the
path PS has taken so far, clearly having to pick her way through the ridges.
click for full size
well the dot is very bright when you click twice for full resolution

The temperature on the Polarstern went positive today (25th May) at 14 UTC and
has remained above zero since.

First hourly value above zero this year. (It came close to zero (-0.1) on 20th
April)

At 82.4 north.

T61 is included as a test for the software calculations. It was 7.05m thick at
deployment

added Tbuoy drift, may1-26. 2 Pbuoys showing drift speed are mostly obscured.

For your information:

360 degree photos from the Polarstern panorama camera are now partially
available here:

https://www.mosaic-panorama.org/?cu=en-GB

The scans are taken every 10 minutes, but stored on the ship due to data
transfer limits. The website therefore mostly contains images from past cruise
legs that came back with the supply vessels. A few more recent ones are also
available though on a one image per day basis.

Cheers, Stefan

The temperature profile animations above  suggest most Tbuoys have ~20cm snow
and also give an indication of how difficult it is to estimate snow thickness
from temperature readings alone. Total ice+snow thickness is likely to be more
accurate. The method is described fully as it developed here

above freezing temperatures for the other one i guess.

   I hope somebody is tabulating these direct observations of surface melt with
readings from satellite sensors to help calibrate interpretation of signals to
distinguish between air moisture vs. surface melt vs. melt ponds vs. open
water.  That would add to the knowledge being gained by having the MOSAIC folks
present at the scene of the crime during melt season.

    From the Norwegian Meteorological Institute:
    Strong sea-ice drift for MOSAiC in 2020
    https://cryo.met.no/en/mosaic-drift2020
    Quote

        Since January, Polarstern has drifted much faster than the ice drifted
        in the previous ten years.
        ...
        The animation shows the trajectory of the MOSAiC drift campaign (red)
        from its beginning in October 2019 and 10 simulated trajectories (other
        colors) from recent years. The drift of Nansen’s Fram from January to
        April 1896 is also shown. The simulated trajectories are initiated at
        the position of MOSAiC on January 1st, and continued until May 1st.
        They are based on the EUMETSAT OSI SAF sea-ice drift product (OSI-405).

Posting the animation with another quote to accentuate how much faster the 2020
drift has been.
Quote

    Since January, Polarstern has drifted much faster than the ice drifted in
    the previous ten years. In the same four month period (Jan-April) in 1896,
    Fram drifted only about half the distance. This is likely a result of a
    weaker ice pack. The ice in the Arctic Ocean has become significantly
    thinner, but also much younger, than only a few decades ago. This means
    that it can be more easily moved around by winds and ocean currents.

    First hourly value above zero this year. (It came close to zero (-0.1) on

    At 82.4 north.


Polarstern is back below 0 C again today 28th May at 10 UTC after spending the
past 68 hours (almost 3 days above zero).

I wonder did the buoys (above the surface) record a similar length of time
above zero ? Or were there any surface inversions at play.

    Both the thick sea ice and the ice pressure cause ongoing tough
    times for the Polarstern in the high Arctic latitudes. However, when
    observing for several hours the same ice floe through the ships'
    windows, the view is not getting tedious. Instead, the opposite is
    true: The ongoing temperatures above the freezing point lead to a
    fast and impressive change of the sea-ice surface. While a couple of
    days ago, we observed consistent white ice floes, these turned into
    increasing blue surfaces. The reason is the widespread snow
    melting due to the high temperatures. In addition, already snow-
    free areas allow for the formation of first melt ponds on the ice.
    These observations give clear evidence of the begin of the Arctic
    summer melt season in that area - one of the most exciting and
    important phases for the Arctic sea ice and its associated
    interdisciplinary processes.

from 40cm above snow/ice level to ~thermistor48, then erratic data, then a
partial recovery.
Perhaps a temporary submerge.

Yes, they left the mosaic floe late on may16. For PS to be travelling at
yesterday's speed, there must have been a lot of 'slush' on that route.
Unfortunately no panomax updates up to this point. No S1 yesterday. No buoy
updates yet today either.

ROV video from article above, best viewed fullscreen



Quote

    On the last day of 2019, Christian Katlein learned first-hand just how
    important it can be to explore the Arctic sea ice from below. As the BEAST
    slowly drew closer to the underside of the ice, on the display he suddenly
    saw collections of delicate ice platelets, which seemed to hang like cirrus
    clouds under the ice and glittered in the ROV’s spotlights. The first
    thought that crossed Katlein’s mind was that it reminded him of a
    snow-covered forest in winter, glittering in the sun. “Until that day, we
    had only ever seen platelet ice in the Antarctic. Finding it in large
    quantities below the MOSAiC floe in winter came as a complete surprise to
    us,” the physicist recalls.

    Accordingly, Katlein and his colleague, the AWI oceanographer Dr Benjamin
    Rabe, began investigat-ing the phenomenon in more detail. They found a
    first clue in the temperature readings from the ocean buoys deployed in the
    vicinity of the MOSAiC floe. They all indicated that the top five metres of
    the water column had become supercooled during the winter, i.e., the
    temperature was ca. 0.01 degrees Celsius below the actual freezing point
    for the seawater. So why didn’t it freeze?

    “The Arctic seawater is so calm, and especially so clean, that it contains
    virtually no crystallisation nuclei like dust particles, algae or other
    tiny impurities. But these are necessary for the formation of ice
    crystals,” says Katlein. It is only when the supercooled water below the
    underside of the sea ice collides with crystallisation nuclei that the
    often platelet-like ice crystals are formed. The experts observe the same
    effect when they lower cables or metal measuring rods into the supercooled
    water below the surface; after just a short time, they are covered with
    crystals.


Some details in the latest fomo. 6 rainy days but doesn't say when.
213 ice cores totalling 393m so average core thickness = 1.845m. We don't know
where they are from.

Re: MOSAiC news English Transcript of Audio logbook

« Reply #835 on: June 06, 2020, 09:00:45 PM »
Here is an English language transcript of the Audio logbook podcast (otherwise
only in German) that was made by the expedition leader Torsten Kanzow during
the journey from the MOSAiC floe to Svalbard. The recording was made on Monday
25. May, but it wasn't published on the MOSAiC website till Friday 29th May and
of course it has now been overtaken by events as the Polarstern arrived in
Svalbard on Thursday 4th June. What it does reveal, very politely and
politically correctly phrased, is that there appears to have been quite a lot
of friction between the shore base and people on the Polarstern about how best
to deal both with the disintegrating floe and the consequences of the pandemic.

Mosaic_Audio_logbook16

Commentator: Arctic Drift - the audio logbook.

Torsten Kanzow: in the meantime we know that our female and male colleagues,
the scientists belonging to the next leg of the expedition, and of course the
crew of the Polarstern who will be on the ship during the next leg, have
arrived in Spitzbergen, together with the research vessels Sonne and Merian,
and that  they are, in principle, waiting for us. However, there’s not the
remotest possibility of  us being able arrive there in the next few days.

Commentator: on the 16 May, after a delay of a week, the Polarstern was finally
able to leave the  Mosaic ice floe to complete the handover to the next team in
the Norwegian Spitzbergen group of islands. But the journey South has proved to
be tough and arduous. The research icebreaker has had to fight its way through
thick arctic ice and continues to test the patience and endurance of the crew
to the limit. The delayed departure turned out to be rather different from the
one that those responsible for it had originally planned. This was the result
of drastic changes in the floe, as Torsten Kanzow, who is the leader of the
third leg of the expedition, explains.

Torsten Kanzow: we had certainly intended to bring some of the equipment on
board to protect it from any possible kind of damage and had made a plan.  Then
we were warned that a storm was approaching that was very, very well forecast,
so that we were able to make a great effort to get all the planned pieces of
equipment on board before it arrived.  That effort succeeded very well. But
then as the storm subsided we were able to see that the floe was disintegrating
far more extensively  than beforehand.  We had already seen that some areas of
the floe had split off from it and collided resulting in ice pressure ridges
being formed, but then after the storm had ebbed, and we were able to see what
had happened, it was quite clear that we would have to bring a lot more
equipment on board to protect it and to make sure it could be used by the
participants of the next leg of the expedition. That meant that we had to take
two additional days to rescue the tents, such as, for example, those of Balloon
town in Ocean City.  We had to witness the fact some areas had now become
inaccessible. In the light of this development it was clear that the decision
to salvage much of the equipment had been a good one. Especially when we saw
that a monitoring station, that had been located in the area of the city, was
destroyed by the formation of a pressure ridge the day before its planned
salvage.  In addition, a tent that the Sea ice group had used for investigating
the underside of the ice with a remote-controlled submarine also fell victim to
the ice. Some of the instruments that were anchored in the ice could not be
rescued either, simply because they couldn’t be located in the newly formed ice
ridges. So that is what happened in the last few days that we spent there. I
think that the decision that was made about them was a good one. We were able
to salvage much more equipment than the original plan had foreseen. As a
result, the prospects for the team of the next leg using this equipment to get
off to a flying start are now quite good. 

Commentator: in the weeks beforehand the leads and tears in the central
observatory,  were becoming daily more numerous. When Kanzow and his team bid
the floe farewell they left behind a completely fissured landscape that didn’t
bear comparison with the extensive solid floe  with which they were confronted
when they started the third leg of the expedition  at the beginning of March.

Torsten Kanzow: the floe is unrecognizable. The state it was in when we took it
over gave the impression that it was large, easily accessible area, on which
one could work without any problems. That changed relatively soon, and we were
already clearly able to see that the radius of action for our daily work was
becoming limited as a result of the ice movements. However, what we saw then
was nothing in comparison to what happened at the end of our stay: that was a
completely different category of floe disintegration. I think that it has
fallen apart in such a way now that you can’t really talk about a MOSAiC floe
anymore. It’s just a patchwork carpet of ice that you can’t work on in any
meaningful way.

Commentator: even if most of the instrumentation that was deployed on the
MOSAiC floe could be salvaged and brought on board, the researchers still had
to leave some measuring devices behind that may be of use to the next leg’s
team.

Torsten Kanzow: for sure, some instruments were left behind.  Ones that measure
the drift, the dispersion of the ice by the winds and currents. We also left
equipment behind that was embedded in the floe itself and measures the internal
temperature of the ice as well some that monitors ocean water parameters.  Some
of this equipment was left behind, in part, because it would have been
impractical to salvage it.  In particular, salvaging some of the
instrumentation for oceanographic monitoring out of two metre thick ice would
have been very, very challenging and labour intensive and could only have been
carried out by a few appropriately qualified people, so that in the end we
weren’t able to salvage everything that would have liked to. But naturally, the
measurements that these instruments will make, if they survive, will be very
valuable. That’s because the continuity of the data they produce will be
maintained. Time series will now continue to be recorded during the transition
to spring and summer that we are currently so strongly experiencing, with
temperatures in the meantime now around freezing point.  We will be able to
continue with these measurements during this important phase until our
colleagues are on site and can resume the recordings in the snow and ice.

Commentator: After being in action for 79 days, the protracted return journey
has given the leader of the third leg a little time to reflect not only about
the preliminary scientific findings, but also about personal experiences and
highlights during the last three intensive months.

Torsten Kanzow: naturally, there were some things that were dramatic. It was
very often, let me put it this way, the dynamic power that the ice embodied
during this period of the year that we,  or at least I personally, hadn’t quite
expected.  When one discussed this with colleagues there was the assumption
that, during this part of the year, we would be able to work on ice that would
be solid and quiescent. However, that was far from being the case.  I think
that that, in itself, is a very interesting finding. We could observe some big
changes just because we were there for such a long time. For instance, the
change from the record lowest temperature on the ice that was measured  during
the expedition. This  was, if I remember rightly, minus 42. And now, towards
the end of the leg, we are experiencing temperatures around zero. This range of
conditions and the change in the ice and snow itself that was already a
highlight. We also saw big changes in the Ocean: we saw that the extent of the
water layer that formed immediately under the ice became extremely deep during
our leg. The values we measured were very large and it will be very interesting
to analyse them further, especially in conjunction  with other large changes
that we observed in the ice and the atmosphere.

Torsten Kanzow: what personal impressions have I taken away? I think that this
journey was accompanied by a lot of high and low points, both with respect to
living together with the team and also with how the world outside the ship was
viewed, that we had to and did    live through. One thing that, let’s say,
perhaps demanded the most from me and that I perceived as a big challenge is
communication. Communication about the ship and about the situation that we
were experiencing and the different perspectives about it that people had who
were faced with the challenge of performing their own scientific work under
extreme conditions, but who were then faced with another set of conditions and
uncertainties from outside the expedition that had nothing to do with their
work.  And then there was communication between the ship and the scientific and
logistic groups that were involved with MOSAiC. That was also an enormous
challenge: to describe our observations and the conditions in which we found
ourselves in such a way as to make it understandable. The way that actually
happened - I’ve never lived through anything like that before.   There’s a big
range of impressions about this and its not just black and white.   There were
many positive moments, for example, because we were able to see that despite
having lots of different viewpoints, we were always able to motivate ourselves
to work together well and we all pulled together. Naturally it was greatly
satisfying to see that measurements continued to be made successfully, despite 
the very rapidly changing external factors (Ed.- the pandemic) and the
consequent uncertainties in the planning that arose with respect to the
changeover between the legs and despite all the dynamic changes that we were
experiencing on the ice. That we were able to remain  productive and to
continue deal with each other in a friendly manner under this pressure was an
enormous achievement. 

Commentator: The demoralizingly long return journey of the Polarstern may be
testing the patience of a lot the crew. However, both the scientists and the
crew can are quite clear about what their next big goal is. 

Torsten Kanzow: Our mission now is to reach Spitsbergen as soon as possible. 
We should have arrived there 2 days ago,  if the original plan had been adhered
to or if our ideas had been listened to.  In the meantime, we know that our
female and male colleagues from the next leg and of course the exchange crew of
the Polarstern have already arrived  in Spitsbergen (Ed. this podcast was
recorded on Monday 25. May and broadcast Friday 29. May) on the research
vessels Merian and Sonne and in principle they are waiting for us. But there’s
not the remotest possibility of us arriving in the next few days. We have now
covered 40 miles from the floe in a southerly direction. That’s during the 9
days we have been travelling so far and we are still about 100 or 120 miles
away from the border between sea ice and open water. After we have reached open
water then perhaps it will take another day for us to reach Spitsbergen.  The
effort of travelling through the ice is extremely demanding: of course we spend
a lot of time looking at satellite observations and how the ice to the south of
us is changing, but, as of now, it doesn’t look as if it’s going to change much
in the next few days.  That means progress is going to continue to be very slow
and looked at soberly it means that we are going to have to continue to be very
patient and not harbour the illusion that we are going to arrive in Spitsbergen
in a day or two. (Ed. it took them another 10 days!)

Commentator: When they have arrived in Spitsbergen, Kanzow will handover
command to the well-known  AWI (Ed. Alfred Wegener Institute) Project leader
Markus Rex, who was already in command on the Polarstern during the first leg
of the expedition at the end of September. By drawing on the experience of the
team from the current leg, he (Rex) will be able to prepare himself in advance
for the new situation in the field

Torsten Kanzow: of course I’m already in communication with the leader of the
next leg, with Markus Rex, and he can see, just as I can, how slow our journey
to Spitsbergen is. Naturally he always got updates from us about how dynamic
the ice was and how difficult the situation there was and is.  I believe the
best advice I can give him is that one should always have plans, but then be
prepared to alter them and that you have to expect changes in the conditions on
the ice  to occur and to have to cope with them.  It’s also important to know
that the situation on the ice must be well described and well communicated to
the women and men scientists who are still working in their labs and that you
have to trust the people who are on the ship to make the right decisions,
because only they can judge what the conditions on the ice are really like. I
believe that that’s exactly what they are going to do on the next leg, so they
probably don’t need any tips from me. But what I do believe is really needed is
to be a bit relaxed and to trust each other, if you are going to get good work
done. That may be a commonplace that holds anywhere in the world, but it
particularly applies to those working on the floe. The next leg faces a big, a
very big, challenge, because they will have to review the situation and will
have to discussed how work can be continued during the coming months. Should
the original floe be returned to? Are good conditions for working expected
there? How will it be possible to achieve that in an ice-system that is
probably going to remain very dynamic as the summer melt sets in, where the
question of how power can be supplied to the equipment is very different from
what it was in the beginning and where fog will have to be contended with – in
other words poor visibility. How is it possible to create a good workplace
environment for everyone on board, especially the women and men scientists?
These are issues that we already had to struggle with during our leg. These are
quite difficult questions and the next team will have to confront them too, but
of course my female and male colleagues know that as well.

Commentator: there is still a long journey in front of Torsten Kanzow and his
team before they can leave the ice behind them and return, hopefully safe and
sound, to their homes. But the Oceanographer doesn’t have to think long about
the answering the question about what he will enjoying doing most when he gets
there.

Torsten Kanzow: of course, what I’ll be happiest about when I return is to see
my family, my wife and my two children, and to have them in my arms. That‘s the
most wonderful thing one can imagine.

That photo is an amazing example of thin plate tectonics. I hope they they have
a record of water mass changes under the ice associated with the storm that
caused the floe to crack up. I wish them luck working in that environment.

Perhaps proximity to ridging with a deep keel makes it worse for thinner ice.

Thanks bl. Perhaps someone could keep an eye on snowbuoys S96(near R11) and S94
(near R12) also, though we might need Niall to interpret S94.

Reworked animation of the Pbuoy swarm since oct4. Note the deployment track on
Dec13. There is also straight line during march and april that needs
investigating. It might be the buoy with the faulty gps though it looks too
straight for that. Some buoys have been left behind but the Pbuoys have a good
survival rate. Ani is a bit bigger at 4MB
I wonder why they didn't deploy more to the north (well, left)
edit: the helicopter deployment has squashed the pallette, need to work on
that: fixed

   Thanks uniquorn.  The May 15 Fram export event shows as a very brief pulse,
but what was going on from mid-March though ca. April 5?  The buoys were moving
fast for several weeks.  I don't remember any dramatic weather at that time.

Breaking through the Arctic pack-ice belt: a difficult and, even in the present
day, unpredictable undertaking

Quote

    On 16 May, RV Polarstern left the MOSAiC floe, which an international team
    of experts has been researching since last October, to pick up the crew for
    the next leg of the expedition off the coast of Svalbard. To reach her
    destination, RV Polarstern had to pass through a belt of multiyear pack ice
    in Fram Strait. The ship is now making her way back to the MOSAiC floe.
    Just how long this will take depends on more than just how thick the ice
    is. In the following interview with meereisportal.de, Captain Thomas
    Wunderlich and Cargo Officer Felix Kentges talk about their experiences
    with icebreaking and explain why open leads in the ice, as well as the snow
    on the floes, are important aspects.

Mosaic thermistor buoys living in interesting times. Each one with it's own
story to tell.
Air temperatures on the left, snow/ice, then ocean on the right. As air
temperatures have risen, the shallow gradient through the ice has made it very
difficult to identify the ice ocean interface, so there are no easy to read
thickness charts.
Many of the buoys have been immersed, T69 looks like it has been ridged, others
(not shown) present the same almost straight line data every day. T61 was
deployed on a floe 7.1m thick so has a very different profile.
Thermistors are 2cm apart.

PS distance from central observatory this morning. They were making very good
speed taking advantage of favourable drifts. Slowing down a bit now.

    <snippage>
    T61 was deployed on a floe 7.1m thick so has a very different profile.



Remembering profiles from a few years ago, T61 has a temperature profile over
time which matches the curve you used to see pretty much anywhere in the pack. 
It is now the exception rather than the rule.

It suggests that over most of the ice, energy currently being applied to it is
going directly into causing phase change rather than warming the ice up to
melting temperature.

Considering the huge amount of energy phase change requires, that may not seem
like much, but it translates into a change in the dynamics of the system
overall, in particular the timing.  It is another piece of data that suggests
the ice is becoming vulnerable to insolation weeks earlier in the melt season,
effectively extending it, exactly when insolation is at its highest.

This is a really cool picture of the MOSAIC floe now that the new team has
returned to home base.

Maybe Uniquorn can show us where the picture was most likely taken.  It was
their most recent post. I saw it about 10 hours ago, but was busy at work so
could not post it here until now.

PS bow radar, jun19-23. The smaller image inset somewhat imitating the buoy
movement above.
The grid makes it easy, if a bit tedious, to register the images to 82N 9E
Individual floes in the main image shuffling positions due to the movement. It
a shame the images are 6hrs apart. They might clarify tidal vs eddies if they
were hourly.

added a rammb gif of the area. It's been cloudy over their location but the ice
edge gives an idea of the movement

Interesting and weird. Is that a buoy that is on a much thicker floe, by any
chance?

p159. I think it has been retrieved. Maybe it was a marker for some more
expensive equipment.

Leg4 team ocean won't be disappointed. mosaic buoy whoi-itp94 is already
showing lower salinity and a markedly different temperature profile. Latest
ocean profiler Vbuoy report was only up to jun15 but I think they are not
posted so regularly.

I looked more closely at p159. It only reports hourly and has a lot of missing
drift speed data. The animation probably struggles to process it correctly with
the other buoys.

Temperature profiles for all the buoys I could find with thermistor data. M29,
t63 and t70 appear to show bottom melt. I'd welcome any expert opinion on
interpreting the near surface temperatures.

Wow Sir! :o
You may have just set a New world records for the most information anyones ever
crammed into a 40 second silent video.
I'm counting  6 that are melted out or in holes full of water, possibly
malfuct.
Apart from that...
Am I correct the thermistors are 2cm spacing?
If so, the rest look between about 70cm and 150cm.
With the exception of t61. The bottom of that on may be off the graph. Was that
the one in a pressure ridge? There kinda looks like a bit of a flat toe right
at the end, though at about minus three C. Its probably soggy with brine thats
been leached down from above from there to Its ragged butt.
Theres a couple that have lumps of higher temps near their bottoms, which if
not sensor failure could be the result of being freely plumbed to melt ponds
and finished with their initial brine flushing cycle. Hence fresh enough for
the warmer surface heated water to be denser than cold melt water, and
therefore be busily engaged in burrowing for freedom.
If 61 has a longer string I'd love to see, say the last month of the whole
thing. Core temp is still below top and bottom temps on that chart, though
rising steadily. If Its on a ridge melt ponding probably won't confuse things,
and it would be very interesting observing the dynamics of Its deep keel as it
melts.

Overall most of them seem about 1m thick, and probably melting both top and
bottom. FollowMosaic site has been listing -1.5 or -1.6 water temps this last
week. Which is about 0.3C above melting at local salinity. So the ice bottom
temp is clamped at about minus 1.8, and the top of the ice at about 0C.
61 could actually be melting at -3C in Its Briney nether regions, and for that
matter quite probable that dips below -1.8C in the cores of any the rest is due
result to brine pockets chewing their innards into honeycomb ice. Rather than
not yet being at thermal equilibrium as some may assume. One to two days above
melting point is sufficient for that in such thin and young ice.
Around 1m thick agrees with Hycoms chart in that region. The "fortress" and PS
are about 100km into the pack, directly nth of Svalbard by my guestimascione
right now. Not sure how widely spread the buoys are. 1 degrees latitude is a
smidge over 110km up there (just over 111 near the equator). Longitude much
less and less again further north of course.

If the data is accurate, it is very worrisome to have only a meter thick ice
that far up north, especially with the current extreme weather pattern, there
is a very real chance of a sizeable clearout, even at 85-90, where ice is
supposedly safe, by the end of the season

update on cryosphere innovation 387850 which is now showing significant bottom
melt, all the snow has gone and that looks like top melt or melt pond.
Also an mp4 of its 192 sensor digital temperature chain, similar to the
thermistor buoys, oct6 to jul2.
hopefully got the datetime right

Following up on 387850 and looking more closely at -4C to +4C since may24. Note
that the melt pond (or submerged pond) temperature rises above zero, probably
during high insolation, and during jun30-jul1 remains above zero even when air
temperatures drop below zero at 'night'.

The latest findings on the MOSAiC floe

The New Siberian Islands were the birthplace of the MOSAiC floe: the sea ice in
which the research vessel Polarstern is now drifting through the Arctic was
formed off the coast of the archipelago, which separates the East Siberian Sea
and the Laptev Sea to the north of Siberia, in December 2018. Sediments, and
even small pebbles and bivalves, were incorporated into the ice during the
freezing process, which the ongoing melting process has brought to light on the
surface of the MOSAiC floe. This is an increasingly rare phenomenon as today,
most "dirty ice" melts before it even arrives in the Central Arctic. These are
among the main findings of a study that MOSAiC experts have published now in
the journal The Cryosphere, and which will provide the basis for numerous
upcoming scientific assessments.

...

The MOSAiC floe had already drifted over 1200 nautical miles in a meandering
course when the research icebreaker Polarstern moored to it on 4 October 2019,
at the coordinates 85° North and 137° East, and began to drift with it through
the Arctic Ocean. While the current expedition team is busy taking readings in
the Arctic, their colleagues back at home are analyzing the data gathered. The
precise analysis confirms the first impressions from the beginning of the
expedition: "Our assessment shows that the entire region in which the two ships
looked for suitable floes was characterized by unusually thin ice," reports Dr.
Thomas Krumpen, a sea-ice physicist at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz
Center for Polar and Marine Research (AWI).

How thick is the ice at their location, that's what I'd like to know since long
because that would allow for a better assessment of the various models, i.e
PIOMAS and HYCOM.

At least one measured and confirmend value, perhaps even many more with all the
buoeys.

Nice ninja post, see the edit above yours, thanks again will have a few more
looks ;)

This one shows around 80cm, that's less than I was hoping.

Ice thickness''   : 77-83 cm
Snow thickness : 7 cm
Freeboard'        : 5 cm

Under current conditions that does not look promising for the ice at this
specific location:

The surprise to me is that the ice in that general area of the Mosaic floe
didn't look that bad on Worldview on June 30 when that helicopter picture of
the Polarstern was taken.  With the clear skies over so much of the Arctic
recently, it now looks like vast areas in worse shape than this, at least to
the untrained eye.

It has been so frustrating that the scientists on board MOSAIC have not done a
better job of showing us what they are seeing!

I like all of the scientists that participated. I understand they want some
time to publish their findings and they are entitled to that.

But, the BS pics of people in the pool or the lunch room, instead of showing
the ice has really ticked me off! They could have been providing us with
pictures and temperatures and ice thickness measurements this whole time, and
it would not have impacted their ability to be first to publish.

i have lost a lot of respect for some of the scientists on this mission because
of the way they refused to provide basic data that would not have in anyway
impacted their ability to be first to publish.

The system does not encourage scientists to interact with the public. In many
cases it discourages it. They didn't need an expensive helicopter to get good
images for public consumption. A drone with a video camera would have provided
lots of good visuals for the public and maybe even some good information for
science. It's pointless to get angry with the scientists but I agree with you
that lunchroom photos are annoying unless you are a friend or family.

I was once an academic researcher, and I agree my comments were too hard on

In fact, the more I think about your post, the more I become pissed at them!

We don’t have much time to get AGW under control. I would think the scientists
studying it would give us the data to convince people it is a problem!

I, too, am frustrated, Rod with the level of communication of climate science
research to the public. My research career cannot be described as brilliant but
I learned a lot about the politics of science. I developed nuclear waste safety
research programs and managed them with national labs and universities. I
approved and oversaw research grants with universities. When Newt Gingrich &
the GOP took over congress in 1994 all of our nuclear waste safety research was
closed down.

Perhaps EU scientists don't have to deal with such crazy political wind shifts
as U.S. scientists, but there are systemic reasons why scientists are not
engaging very well with the public.

I oftentimes felt the same.

The thing though is, we are ice nerds. I bet the majority of people looking at
that site aren't. The PR team is hoping to attract more people to the project.

Has anyone been able to spot the floe and Polarstern on sentinel sat images?
There's a cloud free view on the 7th and it should be near this spot according
to the coordinates on their blog. But I can't quite seem to see anything.

That was totally justified, I would wish sometimes that exaxtly this kind of
analysis would be considered upon other opportunities and what adds to it is
that especially now in corona many scientists wonder why people are not glued
to their lips.

A lot is about funding and careers, understandable in general but no
appropriate when it comes to "To Be Or Not To Be" topics at hand.

Trivia:

In this German TV show 'DARK' (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5753856) i'm
currently watching there are scenes from the 80s (it's about time travel and
whatnot, good show). In one scene you hear the news on the radio. The
newsreader talks about how the Polarstern just went for an expedition to
research the Ozon hole in Antarctica.

Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the Polarstern is doing science since 1982 for us.
38 years!

Will they stay with the floe to the bitter end? Depending on the wind it might
look like this.

    It’s done! After 119 days in the ice, we past a super sharp ice edge. While
    the ice gave us a tough time since we left the @MOSAiCArctic  floe 2.5
    weeks ago, the transition into open water was rather quick. We will reach
    Isfjorden later today.

Quote

    By Matthew Shupe

    6/19/20 Taking things head on
    We ran into the floe. Directly. While scientifically we decided it would be
    best to moor to the floe along the ship’s port side to facilitate CTD
    operations, others onboard have been concerned about the Polarstern’s
    ability to hold its position alongside the floe in the face of ice
    pressure. We’ve, of course, experienced a lot of pressure thus far, which
    has been a great challenge at times. And so, the decision was made to
    instead drive straight into the floe and attempt to embed Polarstern. This
    type of position, the thinking goes, would allow the ship to be effectively
    protected from some of the ice forces by the floe itself. Polarstern
    cruised out from our parking spot from the last days and navigated around
    the floe to the south and then east, then cruised full speed ahead directly
    into the SE flank of the remaining MOSAiC floe. The ship was eventually
    stopped by the very thick ice, ridged and chunky. Backed up for another go,
    trying to embed further, but no such luck. The floe was not allowing such
    an entrance, and instead a crack opened up to the port side and another
    chunk of the floe broke off. Ever smaller the floe gets. In the morning the
    captain maneuvered the ship so that the starboard side was along the ice
    floe, and we will stick in this position and see how things go.

Maybe they didn't get the location quite right on that image. The open water
doesn't match up with bow radar or today's S1. It's possible there was rapid
change in that eddy.

I was thinking something doesn't fit.

And yesterday the water temperature went down to minus 1.6˚C again and the
image a) showed them to the right of that open water area and b) the area of
open water reduced.

Mysterious!

The @MOSAiCArctic ice floe speeds up southwards and goes down the drain in Fram
Strait

This experimental AMSR2 product enhances refrozen leads.

Polarstern and Fram track are hopefully better distinguishable for red-green
color-blind.

    The @MOSAiCArctic ice floe speeds up southwards and goes down the drain in
    Fram Strait


A most enlightening comparison with the original Fram!

Thanks Lars.

Jul16-22 mosaic multisensor map (forgot to include dates), click to run
I slowed the animation down a bit and improved the contrast near the PS
location on 3 of the images. PS just skirts the open water of the eddy. The
bright dot is easily visible.
click twice for full res.

Fascinating!

Side effect of weak ice (sadly) is we get to see the movement of currents
crossing into the central basin.

Wow, PS (bright dot, centre) is going right through the middle of the eddy.
08:17UTC today

Quote

    bow radar shows the ship rotating wildly 270º in the last 24 hrs, still
    attached to the floe but with a large area of open water on the port side
    and in front of the bow.

    The PS is moving south at about 22 km/day despite a moderate tail wind of
    4-5 km/hr and has just crossed the 80º parallel where nullschool first
    starts showing EGC currents, of ~14 km/day.

Sea Ice Ticker No. 46, 27 July 2020: Central Arctic much too warm for July
Quote

    The Central Arctic is currently much warmer than the long-term mean,
    continuing the trend that has been apparent since June this year. Average
    air temperatures at the 925 mb level (roughly 760 m above sea level) for
    the first half of July were unusually high over the central Arctic Ocean –
    up to 10 degrees Celsius. These above-average temperatures were connected
    to high sea-level pressure centred over the East Siberian and Chukchi Seas.
    Arctic temperatures along the Russian coast were near or slightly above
    average. This represents a significant change from June, when temperatures
    along the Siberian coast of the eastern Laptev Sea were up to 8 degrees
    Celsius above average. It is likely that these high temperatures, combined
    with ice movement away from the coast, initiated early ice retreat along
    the Russian coast, and the opening of the North-East Passage. At present,
    the ice extent is extremely low – the lowest level for this time of year
    since the beginning of satellite observation. Sea-ice extent in the Arctic
    has been at a historically low level since 1 July 2020. On 19 July, the ice
    extent was 570,000 km² lower than the former record low in 2019. This
    sea-ice loss is represents an area roughly the size of France. 26 July this
    difference reaches still a value of circa 260.000 km². The coming weeks
    will show how this will affect the overall ice development and the MOSAiC
    expedition.


This ani shows all the mosaic buoys that I could find to see how they coped.
One is temporarily spinning in the eddy, another has possibly met it's end. No
drift speed.

Sea-ice extent in the Arctic at a historical low

Quote

    Meanwhile, the Polarstern is currently in Fram Strait between Svalbard and
    Greenland. Prof Markus Rex, Leader of the MOSAiC Project and an atmospheric
    physicist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Potsdam, is currently on
    board. As he reports: “All the ice around us has long-since broken up or
    been ground into fragments. But our MOSAiC floe, selected for the
    expedition back in October 2019, continues to offer an impressively stable
    basis for our work. Nevertheless, even this floe will soon end its
    lifecycle in the marginal ice zone. Today we measured a balmy 14 degrees
    Celsius 300 m above the floe, and the melting is in full swing. For the
    last phase of MOSAiC, our focus will be on the freezing phase: the last
    piece of the puzzle in our observations of the Arctic’s annual cycle.
    Accordingly, in the last phase we will proceed far to the north, where the
    freezing will soon begin.” This will most likely take place in mid-August,
    once the last resupply and exchange of research staff and crew have been
    completed.


Hopefully they are stocking up with more buoys  ;)

Time to Say Goodbye

Quote

    The MOSAiC floe’s days are numbered, but Polarstern will continue the
    expedition further north

    [31. July 2020]  After exactly 300 days of drifting with the MOSAiC floe,
    the international team around Expedition Leader Markus Rex on Wednesday, 29
    July 2020, started the dismantling of the research camp and evacuation of
    the floe. Just one day later the floe finally broke into several fragments.
    After accompanying the floe on its journey for ten months, the team will
    now shift its focus to the last remaining puzzle piece in the annual cycle
    of Arctic sea ice: the start of the ice formation process.

The Polarstern moved south and crossed an eddy. They recorded above zero water

Itp 94 deployed by the Mosaic campaign has finished Its run and returned some
very disturbing readings. Dissolved oxygen at near zero for the whole Atlantic
side transit. Dissolved and particulate organic matter, turbidity through the
roof. I desperately hope the DO sensor was faulty. But it would explain why all
the polar bears were way out on the Atlantic front.
Major high turbidity upwelling from well below 760m depths was detected out
near the pole. Suspect that sediment and methane laden bottom freshwater flow
from Laptev and/or 79N NE Greenland subglacial outbursts have busted the deep
halocline stability out in the deep basin bringing up ex-hypersaline
bottomwater mass from the deep basin. VERY scary. Our much appreciated
contributer
 Veli albert kallio is the world acknowledged professional expert on this kind
of thing. We've had discussions previously  about this sort of possibility,
with Wadhams and other experts I work with involved. I'll get a conference
going. We may have to look at urgent oxygen and salt restoratation in deep
benthic Atlantic side of the Lomonosov.
Would be very helpful if Uniquorn can do one of his locations/date animations
over bathometry so we can localise events clearly.

Polarsterns been sampling that eddy for precisely that reason. This looks like
well over 20 gigatons of subglacial outbursts in the NW alone in the last few
weeks. Not only are they heavy with up to 90% rock, capable of carving canyons
over 1000 km out into deep ocean basins, but the surging of fast glaciers can
melt the bedrock at 1500 C plus, so they can be very warm indeed.

Another visitor from Fantasyland? No glacier is 90% rock, no glacier carves
canyons over 1000km out into deep ocean, and no glacier ever reaches
rock-melting temperatures at bottom.

Slightly OT, but from GSA (Rock glacier morphometry, San Juan Mountains,
Colorado: Summary)
Quote

    Rock glaciers are common periglacial denudation features above timberline
    in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado. They occur as
    porridge-like lobate or tongue-shaped masses of rock and ice which move
    downslope at rates of as much as 100 cm/yr (Barsch, 1977).

Walking on them in mid-summer, all you see is rock, so "90% rock" might be
right.  (Internet searches show rock glaciers occur elsewhere, too.)

But your other complaints are good.

I'm sorry, I should have been cleared, I ment the downstream flows down the
underwater river canyons can be ninety percent rock, meaning everything from
loess to large boulders, and Organic matter, etc. Some call them submarine
lahars. Outbursts megafloods are called that because they peak at over a
million tons per second.
Haven't heard of anyone getting published on what solids content the flows
through the underground lakes and their connections contain, but Its quite
visible them emerging from all the NE Greenland glaciers in recent weeks just
on worldviews images. Often theres huge outflows and then sometimes  backsurges
in the floes on the surface of the deep fiords, as the whole pulse goes through
at the bottom. You can see sediment discolouring bursts at the calving  front
up to fifty km wide sometimes but the big flow is shooting north from under the
rapidly disintegrating ice shelf, with the fragments being whisked away by the
entrained surface current. Theres a huge basin below sealevel plugged by those
glaciers, and the hydraulic head on the basal lake system is the deep funnel
lakes we see repeating in the same places an shapes for the last years over a
km above.
Both theses and the big Siberian rivers with flood surges send pulses down the
submarine canyons to the deep basins. Which in the Arctic are very much very
poorly understood because they are thousands of different bodys of suffering
salinities temperatures, dissolved mineral,
organic and fine suspended solids that mix poorly.
The comment about rock melting, this does happen under icestreams, so you'd get
superheated steam along with the water expelled into the drainage system,
before the runaway rate of melt causes a crash sudden quench and the base flash
freezes to the bedrock again. Antarctic ice streams have been documented as
pulsing forward at the base up to 100m at several meters per second in this
fashion. Don't think Its known if this in sustained fashion occurs in these
high speed glacier collapses elsewhere. But if either of these big ones, or the
humbolt could that it would be dramatic, uncorking the whole pressurised
interior lake system.
The bad news is the anoxic freshwater seeping out of those silt lahars in the
deep basin has replaced the downwelling oxygen brine chimneys from lost Ice
Shelves and multiyear ice keel that all those scientists were screaming about
the direness would result from this loss ten or more years ago.

Quote from: Tor Bejnar on August 07, 2020, 07:21:24 PM

    Slightly OT, but from GSA (Rock glacier morphometry, San Juan Mountains,
    Colorado: Summary)
    Quote

        Rock glaciers are common periglacial denudation features above
        timberline in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado. They
        occur as porridge-like lobate or tongue-shaped masses of rock and ice
        which move downslope at rates of as much as 100 cm/yr (Barsch, 1977).

    Walking on them in mid-summer, all you see is rock, so "90% rock" might be
    right.  (Internet searches show rock glaciers occur elsewhere, too.)

    But your other complaints are good.


I don't know if cirque glaciers contain more rock per mass than "normal"
glaciers. Cirque glaciers rotate so any debris get caught up and will only
escape as sand and clay suspended in water that spills over the edge of the
depression that these glaciers dig forthemselves.

But having personal experience of glaciers I have never seen one that is more
than perhaps 1% rock.

So-called rock glaciers are more correctly frozen avalanches, i,e. when a
permafrost slope starts moving, and are quite rare, although there are a couple
in  Alaska. Of course, if a moving mass consists mostly of rock then it is not
a "glacier" and thus a "rock glacier" is really a misnomer.

I'd guess that it needs low precipitiation to maintain a rock glacier,
otherwise a "real" glacier should appear on top of it. And of course, they are
presumabley very slow moving - if they move at all?

Sorry Oren, but if you snip the pseudoscience from OTG's post above, I'll
remove this post.

OTG has retreated with all claims except the following:

Quote

    The comment about rock melting, this does happen under icestreams, so you'd
    get superheated steam along with the water expelled into the drainage
    system, before the runaway rate of melt causes a crash sudden quench and
    the base flash freezes to the bedrock again.


This should have been snipped since it is totallly unfounded, unrealistic,
incredible and without any supporting evidence. We Scandinavians learn in
school what bedrock looks like after being covered by a few kms of ice during
the deep ice age, and scoring tracks left by big rocks scratching into the
underlying bedrock are commonly seen. Surface melting is never seen, and just
to imagine that it could happen is indicative of a total lack of scientific
reasoning and real-world understanding.

I agree basal ice streams  mechanisms are ot here. The paper I read on bedrock
melting due to the friction of stop start  ice streams in Antarctica was some
twelve years ago. If binntho wants to learn on an appropriate thread what a
layer of entrained boulders can do as it gouges his grooves in the bedrock when
under the pressure of kilometers of ice and downstream elastic tensions are
suddenly released, I am surprised he is so certain that such heat released by
this friction can't melt rock. But will try to find the paper and post it
there. The flash refreeze physics are what startled me.
More on topic..
The only submarine landslide down a canyons system caught in the act of a flush
wave and the results studied:
"The tsunami following the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake was relatively small but it
was still the most significant event in around 50 years. Being onsite at the
time and in the following months, we were able to document changes to the
seabed and it has revealed some exciting science,” Dr Mountjoy said.

“In January 2017, we surveyed down to 2000m and discovered that large areas of
the Kaikoura Canyon have drastically changed. Sediment has been transported
from the Kaikoura canyon at least 300km north to the deep ocean floor offshore
Wairarapa. The earthquake shook loose a huge amount of mud from the canyon rim
that then flowed down into the canyon channel. As it accelerated downslope,
this material appears to have eroded deeply into the canyon floor and ignited
into a critical condition we call ‘autosuspension’. Amazingly, in this
condition, sediment can flow indefinitely across the ocean floor. We know the
deep sea Hikurangi Channel is 1500km long and this flow may have travelled the
full length of it. No one has ever directly observed this process before – it
is an amazing opportunity.”
This relatively small event moved "well over 850 million tons" of subglacial
debris from the south zelandian ice sheet collapse over 10ky bp down a two to
five km wide canyon carving 20 to 50m extra depth in the bedrock channel.
Zelandia is very simular to Greenland after deglaciation, and this is probably
the smallest of three primary submarine  canyons. All carved by Jökulhlaup as
can be see bursting on a daily basis on worldview from Greenland.
As this one was triggered by a paltry few thousands tons of river sediment
shaken off the top of shelf above canyon head, I cannot imagine this not being
an ongoing process in the arctic daily, and larger, at present.
Deserves Its own thread too. But for those interested:

https://niwa.co.nz/news/
kaikoura-earthquake-generated-huge-submarine-sediment-shift

https://niwa.co.nz/news/a-wave-of-hazard-research

Note the rubble sizes transported in hypersuspension hundreds of km, and the
many canyon systems visible on bathometry that is much higher resolution than
any publicly available for the arctic. Kaikoura is noticably not the originator
of this canyon system, but pegasus off the previously ice covered submerged
land to the southeast where perhaps six major outbursts channels can be seen
from previous deglaciations.
Greenland Zelandia and west Antarctica are very simular continents, in
different geologic periods due to current latitude and climate.
Click on bottom two files for before/ after shelf image of initiating landslide
and animated zoom in on the 2500km extention of the glacial rubble carved
channel out to the Louisville seamount chain.

On thin ice: The Arctic and earth's climate

Quote

    The Arctic plays an important role in the earth’s climate, but our
    knowledge about the winter there is limited. The polar region is changing.
    The sea ice has been shrinking for decades. Why is that? We search for
    answers in the far north.

From the MOSAIC web app:

Quote

    We are making good progress on our way northwards and have
    traveled roughly 150 nm (about 277 kilometers) in the first 24
    hours after we left our mooring position yesterday. This morning
    we had nearly open waters around the ship as we are in the SO-
    called northeastern Greenland polynya: an area of open water,
    which is driven by offshore winds pushing the sea ice away from
    land. At the moment, the ice concentration north of Greenland is
    quite loose compared to areas further east. That's why we decided
    to steam more or less directly to the North, using low ice
    concentrations as long as possible before we turn eastwards and
    look for an ice floe that has properties comparable to the original
    MOSAiC floe.

Very fortunate to having a well-appointed research vessel enter the baffling
area of ice decay between Greenland and the North Pole.

It's not at all clear what the final destination is though the publicist
writing 'Follow' suggests it is out of satellite range which for Sentinel-1AB
is 87.5ºN (WorldView satellites don't have a pole hole but clouds often
preclude imaging). The PS is moving rapidly, a full degree of latitude north in
the last 12 hours (111 km by 20-08-15 19:00 ) plus 2º of longitude west.

They're fixing the helicopters but may or may not share those photos (or much
else en route). The bow radar is no longer reporting at 6 hrs frequency, having
stopped on Aug 9th. If restarted upon mooring, it would benefit from
synchronous overhead views and shipboard commentary.

https://data.meereisportal.de/maps/animations/Iceradar/?C=M;O=D

Let's hope the PS focuses on the current melt season rather than searching for
another meaningless ice jumble. (N-ICE2015 already followed four of them to
oblivion.)

The PS reached the rarely studied Wandel Sea a couple years back after a strong
narrow cyclone blew up the Fram, pushing the ice well north of the flux gate.
The captain toyed with the safety of continuing through the Lincoln Sea and
around Greenland via the Nares. The PI wrote me that the ship is equipped to do
CTD tests on its own and did so (but the data could not yet be shared).

Fram export winds ceased in mid-May, not displaying a consistent pattern since.
Despite the lack of a dramatic storm in the Straits this season, the
'cumulative impact' of moderate but generally non-northerly winds could
possibly explain both the lift-off from the CAA, churning of Lincoln Sea ice,
and the remarkable deterioration towards the Pole.

Since the ice has not been notably pushed, southerly winds would have needed to
bring some mix of sunshine, warm air and overturned warm water acting on
dodgier-than-realized ice.  Morris Jesup is not favorably located for katabatic
winds off the Greenland summit ridge. No one here has systematically examined
online daily records of the automatic weather station there.

This same 'Follow' publicist wrote in a double falsehood yesterday that the
ship had passed through the offshore wind-created Northeast Water polynya. The
facts and location concerning  that water opening have been established from 90
years of arduous on-site field work, beginning with Lauge Koch in 1933.

Read about it here:

Airborn Expendable Ice Buoy (AXIB)
Quote

    An Air-Deployable Expendable Ice Buoy (AXIB) that can withstand multiple
    freeze-thaw cycles and operate equally well in ice prone ocean or fresh
    water. The AXIB can be dropped from an airborne platform, land on an ice
    surface, right itself to the vertical position, anchor and stabilize itself
    in the ice, withstand several freeze-thaw cycles and continue to transmit
    data while anchored to the ice or floating in the ocean. The unique hull
    design of the AXIB allows it to withstand multiple freeze-thaw cycles and
    continue to function. The AXIB is particularly well suited for deployment
    and utilization in any ice zone where repeated freeze-thaw cycles occur.

Very nice, to have supplemental sturdy buoys dropped by airplane out of say
Alert.

Some 33 AIXB have been deployed in recent years; 7 are still active but only 3
of those are high latitude Arctic Ocean:

145951                   2016   AXIB  Healy     86.88  -70.47
300234065497190   2018   AXIB  USIABP   86.41  -44.70
300234065498190   2018   AXIB  USIABP   86.65  -157.31

The hardware graphic above has a bad typo "mast parachute bridal stays (3)"
that throws google search off. These are properly called bridle stays, as for a
horse.

The animation looks to be 640 frames at 6-hr intervals starting on March 30th
and ending for now at 19:00 on August 11th. After rotating and rescaling, the
buoy track is shown over AMSR2 along with the nearby Polarstern position (red
in yellow star) at 09:00 today, 85.0  -15.0. (It's now at 86.0  -18.4 20-08-16
00:00 some 111 km farther north.)

It's best with so many frames to NOT de-optimize the gif but rather 'make new
layer from visible' in Gimp. Then copy and start a new image with this frame.
The needed rotation can be deduced using the -60º longitude line through the
Nares. Scaling can be done rapidly by over-shooting, undo, under-shooting until
convergence of the main latitude line. The palette and text metadata should be
cut out early on and made into separate layers so they are not affected by map
rotation. In gimp, a layer should be expanded using 'layer to image size'
before rotating less parts get lost.

A closer look at iabp buoy 300234065497190, north of Greenland. Drift speed,
rough lat/lon and air temperature. There would appear to be some small tidal
movement in this area also.

    gif won't run

Hmm, works on Opera, Chrome, Safari and Firefox on iMac and Safari on iPhone.

The PS is making incredible headway both north and west almost to the head of
the opening above Greenland, halfway to the north pole itself.

Evidently they don't want to moor in that TransPolar Drift again but instead
seize a very rare opportunity to access the central CAB. (No information is
being furnished today by 'Follow'.)

The PS just turned the bow radar back on two quite interesting frames show the
ice ahead. There's a lot of open water.

Meereis portal has an excellent melt article posted on the 14th describing melt
ponds and ice thickness measurements. They've posted a Sentinel-2 time series
(ie in the visible) which we've not used here to date.
Quote

    We recorded a gradual decrease in the average ice thickness: a drop of
    approximately one metre over the course of July. At the same time, pond
    depths began increasing, until the first holes appeared in the melt ponds
    through which the meltwater poured into the ocean below. In some ponds, we
    recorded spectacular depths of more than 150 cm...

    We used the ablation stake to measure the position of the snow and ice
    surfaces and the hotwire to measure the position of the ice bottom. We
    measured an average of ~85cm of ice thinning across our stakes sites from
    26 June to 30 July. Surface ablation accounted for 75% of that thinning,
    while bottom melting made up the remaining 25%....

    Especially the deep keels that extended more than 8 m into the comparably
    “warm” ocean were eroding quickly. In some parts of the ridged ice, keel
    depth decreased by up to 2 m in just the first 14 days..

    Over 30 digital thermistor chains were deployed across MOSAiC’s Central
    Observatory, which allowed us to monitor the hourly temperature evolution
    in different ice and snow layers though the data is still being processed,
     
    In the end, the decreasing thickness, pre-existing weaknesses, and numerous
    thaw holes in melt ponds made the floe unstable and less able to withstand
    ocean swell and collisions with surrounding floes.

From the mosaic ticker

Quote

    Digital thermistor chains (Fig. 3) are another essential tool for measuring
    changes in ice and snow thickness over time. Over 30 of these units were
    deployed across MOSAiC’s Central Observatory, which allowed us to monitor
    the hourly temperature evolution in different ice and snow layers spread
    out around the floe. Though the data is still being processed, the legs of
    the DTC unit in the photo (Fig. 4) illustrate the progressive ice surface
    melting: the tops of the white tubes were initially installed level with
    the ice surface.


Hourly measurements, possibly requiring regular battery changes. Looks
different to the Tbuoy set up.

Last looks at the ice the Polarstern is traversing, soon it will be in the
Sentinel-1AB pole hole. It's already off the PolarView imagery for the day
(last image, needs click). We'll still have a view but it will be nearly
horizontal (bow radar).

Might the Polarstern stop to download data from buoy 97190 or change its
batteries? No, already far to the north. However the PS might launch a set of
its own new buoys on this leg to over-winter in the CAB.

Polarstern is moving through ice at the equivalent of a decent jog (about 8
kph).  Rather alarming, actually.

Indeed. Even for an icebreaker rated at 2m, it's surprising to see them plow
straight ahead. They must not see a reason to take whatever ice is  in their
path very seriously. It must be a mixture of thin ice and open water like AMRS2
is showing. The last bow radar snapshot shows floes and weak matrix above 87º.
It's not clear whether they are looking for SYI or older CAB ice.

They are ~100 km into the Sentinel-1AB pole hole and WorldView is clouded over.
Let's hope they share some helicopter imagery after mooring.

It appears now like the PS has slowed down to look at the suitability of
individual floes for study. The ship has gone so far west that there is almost
no possibility of further TransPolar Drift. The last thing they want is to be
swept into the Fram again.

If the PS wants to reach the North Pole itself, the going could get tougher.
The scientific justification for that isn't clear. They went to study freeze-up
to mid-October but what is being learned about the end of this extraordinary
melt season may be more important. There is no real likelihood of being
hopelessly frozen in, though depending on winds, the ice could close in.

 Polarstern can break through ice 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) thick at a speed of 5
knots (9.3 km/h; 5.8 mph).

The Polarstern is continuing to move towards (or past, to original lat,lon?)
the North Pole this morning, having covered almost a degree of latitude (111
km) in the last 24 hours with a similar distance to go.

https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html  for converting lat lon
pairs to km

Update 3: the PS has moved significantly poleward and set out its first buoy!
(No tracking number was provided; minimally, it has GPS and air pressure
reporting. Ice thickness was measured but not shared; lots of melt ponds are
visible at 89º.)

90.0  -20.0 20-08-19 10:00    3  170     -0.3
89.3  -36.9 20-08-18 22:00    4  230     -0.7
89.1  -35.6 20-08-18 15:00    5  260      0.7

Lat  Long  YY-MM-DD  UTC     Wind       T(C)
88.9  -35.7 20-08-18 07:00    5   60      1.0
88.0  -39.4 20-08-17 07:00    5   30     -0.1

How fast it can move through pack ice depends very much on the thickness of
that ice, its melt state, age, mechanical strength and compaction pressure from
the sides. While they log ice condition on the fly, it is not shared in nrt
other than via the 6-hr bow radar. (On leg 3 for example, a scientist set up a
forward-facing iphone on time lapse and once back on shore could put it on
twitter. The ship can be seen ramming the ice back and forth at certain times.

We discovered early on that ImageJ (but not Gimp) can open the bow radar .avi
format instantly to grayscale frames, giving full control over cropping,
contrast change, playback speed, frame retention, re-export to avi, and final
conversion to mp4 since forum software only supports avi as non-displaying
attachment. Those operations would be much harder or not doable at all for a
mp4.

In summary, PS is not currently moored to a new floe but bow radar
near-horizontal snapshots of the ice ahead are posted through midnight of Aug
17th. The big question is how mobile the ice pack will be at the final
destination. Bow radar is very good at displaying that. They don't want to
deploy a lot of expensive and irreplaceable equipment out on an unstable floe.

The no-data pole hole of AMSR2_AWI is at 89.2º, the same as before. For now,
the ice concentration at the ship's location can still be seen but just barely.
The weather at this location is unremarkable. Fram export has picked up but the
Polarstern will not be caught up in it.

    DriftStories – 06: Snow, the great unknown

    The number of winter days on which snow falls in the Central Arctic can be 
    counted on one hand. Nevertheless, the amount of snow on the Arctic sea ice
    is a key factor influencing how quickly the ice grows, and when it begins
    melting in the spring. But until recently, little has been known about this
    enigmatic white substance. AWI sea-ice physicists have developed and
    implemented a unique snow research program...

    ... when it comes to local snow accumulation on the Arctic sea ice, snow
    drifts appear to play a far more important role than total precipitation.
    “Because of the strong winds, fresh snow doesn’t simply stay where it fell.
    It is transported and accumulates in large mounds on the ice surface, for
    example in the lea of pressure ridges,” says Daniela Krampe.

    The AWI researchers’ observations have since been confirmed by data from
    the 14 snow buoys that the team had installed on level ice at the beginning
    of the expedition. While the snow layer on the level ice increased only
    gradually, and was still nowhere near the 30-centimetre mark by the end of
    the winter, behind the ridges the researchers soon found themselves
    hip-deep in snow.

interesting that they don't show water temperature on that MET page. They do
report weather conditions so we could see when first snow falls.

Quite 'warm' at -1.4C (from sailwx)

They've arrived at the North Pole after making a smart decision to steam up
through the unusual low concentratio ice north of Greenland. The ice is just
one melt pond after another there. The Polarstern appears to be looking around
for a suitable study floe as longitudes are varying wildly about the pole.

WorldView is currently cloudy; Sentinel-1AB and AMSR2 don't get up this far;
Mosaic rarely releases any imagery of scientific interest. So the only sources
of information on ice condition will come from awiMet and bow radar. The
latter's last frame is 18:00 on the 18th when the PS was at 89.16º.

Is that a photo of what it looks like at the NP? Doesn't look like any of that

    is that at the Northj Pole?

Yes, the photo is cropped from one with leaders holding up a plaque celebrating
the PS arrival at 90º. The water depth at the North Pole has been measured by
Russians at 4,261 m (13,980 ft); the scientific crew here sampled bottom water
and passed around souvenirs.

The two-frame slide show shows ice conditions according to the most recent
AMSR2_AWI. A lot of the ice near the Pole (in the direction of Greenland) is in
the 80-95% concentration range, thus measurably off solid. That doesn't include
ponds that haven't melted all the way through yet.

They are looking for ice stable enough to melt to set up a somewhat dispersed
observatory to get away from ship-generated artifacts yet not get into all the
problems of before with power and data cables, retrievability and safety.
Better ice can be found along the 180º meridian, say 100 km in the direction of
Wrangel.

No thickness or ice temperature profile data has been shared though teams have
already cored through and helicopters have done em-bird mapping rasters.
Thickness alone doesn't suffice as the bottom can be coated with algae and even
scrape off. More information may be gleaned from new buoys but that takes time
to find when the IMEI or Mosaic identification numbers aren't disclosed;
close-in buoys may report over closed circuit rather than Iridium.

The buoy launched a couple days back is not listed under its launch date on the
list of all active buoys. However it appears that buoys launched in 2019,
retrieved from the Fram, and re-launched at high latitude still retain their
2019 launch date in the unsortable table. By keyword searching for 89., 88.,
etc the five highest-latitude Mosaic buoys can be located, including three snow
buoys at 89º.

    Great picture.  Looks like a mix of melt ponds and open water.  Correct? 
Any estimate of thickness of the ice in the picture? (it looks very thin, ca.
0.25 meter?).

Not sure but found past north pole ice thickness in this report.

Initial measurements of the ice thickness confirm this: in 2011 as well as in
2007 the most frequently occurring ice thickness was 0.9 metres. As a
comparison, the most frequently measured ice thickness in 2001 was around 2
metres. In that year the extent of the ice cover at the end of the melting
period corresponded roughly to the long-term mean.

<WUWT is a denier site and is not considered a reliable source. I refuse to
click such links myself so cannot check what this is based on, but if you can
find another source for this info it would be better. O>

    are these photos for real? how thick is the ice at the North Pole?

Yes, so far all the photos posted show the immediate area of the North Pole,
not the usual Greenland icebergs or Antarctic penguins. It's astonishing to see
it all extending out to the horizon, who knew?. The pole areas out to ~200 km
are very difficult to observe because most satellites need to be in near-polar
orbit and require fairly narrow swaths to have any resolution (or work in the
visible and can't see through the clouds).

Mosaic does have some bad photo practices such as wiping Exif data including
GIS, using unstated 'shipboard time' instead of UTC, showing date blogged
instead of the photo timestamp, and not flattening the key data irreversibly
onto the photo jpg file where it cannot be lost, forged or removed except by
cropping. (Even the cheapest flip-phone will do all this.)

The first and fourth photos below from the press release shows freeboard and
submerged ice a little more clearly; the ratio should be 1:9, but how do we
calibrate an absolute scale? Note melt ponds are easily distinguished from
'leads' which are a mixture of leads and icebreaker paths. I don't see a floe
suitable for six weeks of mooring but they have been looking around at the pole
for 9 hours so far.

We've also located incoming data for the three new snow buoys re-launched at
89º in #993. I'll defer to Uniquorn on proper reading of buoy data for S93 but
the green seems to be thickness and as marked by a little box on the y-axis,
seems to be at 0.22 m below sea level. Live links to the data are provided
above.

Mosaic is stating repeatedly that the NP is in the center of the TPD. This is 
false. The pole has rarely been included over the last ten years in the
TransPolar Drift, better named the CircumPolar Drift as it primarily sweeps
around from the Laptev to Frame about halfway to the SZ FJL SV line. This year
though, the drift took in an extraordinary swath of Arctic Ocean including
areas even beyond the pole. It's all been documented repeatedly on enhanced
Ascat time series -- it's futile to argue with unambiguous satellite data but 
people still do.

The other take-away from these shocking pole photos: these melt ponds may be
deepening and even draining but they are not new. Suppose half of the surface
area shown has been ponded or open water since mid-July, the whole way up from
Greenland. This means the albedo has been very low compared to snow on ice
during the high insolation levels. In turn this means fractional BOE is already
upon us in terms of not reflecting excess solar energy back to space regardless
of how the next two months play out.

Melt ponds + leads take up 51% of the pixels in the photo after excision of the
Polarstern; there is slant bias favoring the foreground but an overhead ratio
may well be similar.

Quote

    PI Markus Rex: “Up until 87.5ºN, for the most part we passed through open
    water, in some cases stretching to the horizon. Based on the satellite
    imagery, we weren’t sure whether the loose ice cover was due to wind and
    currents, and were concerned a change in weather conditions could compact
    it again. Once in the region, however, they found that much of the sea ice
    truly had melted away, and hadn’t simply been broken up by the wind.

    Captain Wunderlich: “I’m very surprised to see how soft and easy to
    traverse the ice up to 88° North is this year, having thawed to the point
    of being thin and porous. Even after passing 88° North we mostly maintained
    a speed of 5-7 knots; I’ve never seen that so far north...Normally  it’s
    home to thicker and older ice and virtually impassable. But now we’re
    finding extended stretches of open water reaching nearly to the Pole.

    Moving on from the Pole, the Polarstern may follow the Transpolar Drift a
    bit further (i.e. towards Siberia) until she reaches ~87° North. “Depending
    on the ice conditions, however, we’ll also start looking for a suitable
    floe in the vicinity of the North Pole.


Rex was quoted in a single news story as saying this -- all the other
newspapers cropped it out:

“It's frightening to see how thin the sea ice is and how quickly it is melting.
Something needs to be done urgently. The Arctic cannot wait long."

I like that term 'fractional BOE' and how it makes me think about the system.
The changes to the key things about the Arctic Sea Ice - reducing solar energy
accumulation (albedo) and keeping global weather patterns normal - are not
either/or changes, and they will not stay the same before BOE and then 'flip
over' when BOE happens. They will shift on a gradient, and that gradient can be
expressed as Fractional BOE.

    +1 Ditto, thanks for addressing the thickness question A-Team.

     I just looked at a bunch of August 18-19 images for thickness and
concentration (HYCOMM, Bremen, Hamburg, NSIDC etc.).  Many of the images have a
pole hole so not exact value for 90N, but the collection overall shows rather
striking difference between what is suggested by the various concentration and
thickness images and what is shown in the North Pole photo by MOSAIC and their
description of ice conditions during the trip to 90N.  The NSIDC sea ice
concentration map appears to most closely match the MOSAIC ground truthing
observations.

     UCMiami's comments about new ASI conditions creating a need to recalibrate
or reinterpret established ASI observation methods seems spot on.
Quote from: UCMiami on August 19, 2020, 08:47:45 PM

      <snip>   I feel that the last fifteen years have truly changed the nature
    of arctic sea ice, but a lot of the systems and analysis was established as
    'fact' before that change really manifested and to some degree it has yet
    to adjust.

    <snip> "...measures (Piomas and others) are grounded in a 'solid pack' view
    of arctic ice and I believe struggle to deal with the 'real world'
    condition of the pack where 'thick ice' is actually a patchwork of loose
    flows held together by new and thin ice. Images from Polarstern seem to
    make this abundantly clear."

        established as 'fact' before that change really manifested and to some
        degree it has yet to adjust.

        <snip> "...measures (Piomas and others) are grounded in a 'solid pack'

        condition of the pack where 'thick ice' is actually a patchwork of
        loose flows held together by new and thin ice. Images from Polarstern
        seem to make this abundantly clear."

<wry look>  I tried to provoke a discussion along those lines in the Melt

I think it would be a very good idea, as a lot is happening which categorically
*isn't* being captured in our traditional metrics.

    tried a discussion in the Melt Season thread ...a lot is happening which
    categorically *isn't* being captured in our traditional metrics.

That thread has been hijacked by legacy extent trackers, 10-day wx disaster
forecasters, and self-nominated Nobel laureates (for seasonal weather
prediction, ice physics outcomes six months out, even 2022 melt season finale.)
Quote

    a 'solid pack' view of arctic ice struggles with 'real world' conditions

Looking at Hycom ice thickness at the north pole from July 28th through the Aug
19th photo forward to the Aug 28th forecast, the ice is shown having a fairly
narrow range of thickness, notably 0.75 m at the time the Polarstern was there.
It continues to thin moderately over the forecast week but part of that is just
ice pack motion bringing thinner ice in. Click to see daily thickness.

Piomas thickness could also be tracked down but it too has zero knowledge of
melt pond specifics in its model.

Since no representative measured ice thickness data has been released, actual
thickness remains unknown. It's a pity that Mosaic holds back data to 2023
instead of informing the current melt season.

-- What do we even want 'thickness' and 'volume' to mean when melt ponds of
various depths and evolutionary stages occupy fully half the scene, extending
out beyond the horizon?

-- Did ice physics models have any real awareness of current conditions at the
scale needed? Now that we have data, has it been assimilated? No.

-- What is the effect of draining melt ponds on floe buoyancy and does that
fool freeboard satellite altimeters?

-- Could 'averaging' somehow average away melt ponds and leads when they
nevertheless dominant the scene at all scales? How is the remaining ice scored
after melt ponds drain?

-- Who knew in advance what 88-90º would look like? Nobody. If the PS had not
taken those photos, would we ever have known? No.

Meanwhile the PS has left the pole, already 150 km south along the 105th
meridian looking for a suitable floe to moor onto. This will take them back
into satellite range and back into the TransPolar Drift which is not drifting,
but not quite back to their original October lat lon of 85.1  134.3. 
Sentinel-2 can image melt ponds on clear days (lol) to 10 m resolution (not
quite enough).

According to Ascat, this is FYI formed in the Laptev. It might have maxed out
as 2m in late February but is assuredly thinner by now, sub 1m. It's
questionable whether they will find a thick enough floe to work on safely --
freeze season is still six weeks off and they'll be leaving before that really
sets in. The better CAB floes are off on higher different meridians, say the
180th meridian to Wrangel.

/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

Forum discussion of melt pond energetics -- a very big topic in Arctic academia
-- went way off the rails. The sky and water are blue from Rayleigh elastic
scattering, not adsorption of light and conversion to heat. Insolation energy
at the surface is largely at visible wavelengths. Neither H[2]0 nor ions like
Na^+ or C^l- have any ability to accept photons at these wavelengths.

Melt ponds are clear to the bottom regardless of salinity. The ice bottoms of
melt ponds are reflective white, scattering incoming light in all directions
including down. Melt pond albedo is thus less of a drag on fractional BOE than
open water albedo. Indeed shallow melt ponds have an albedo of 0.4-0.5 per
NSIDC. Yet ROV images show some sunlight manages to pass below everything
above.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165232X15003171

Adsorptive impurities abound even though the scene looks pristine: wildfire
ash, miscellaneous industrial and agricultural pollutants and plastics,
thermokarst shore erosion, river sediment, fallen aerosols, desert dust,
volcanic ash, flakes of unburned bunker fuel, algae and copepods channeled into
the ice bottom, and so on and on. Those do convert light to heat (molecular
motion) and that heat equilibrates with the surrounding water.

In summary, a good portion of incident sunlight energy is scattered back into
the atmosphere, melt ponds lessening that somewhat. The rest is absorbed
somewhere in the 'water column', mostly in the upper few meters, the exact
apportioning depending on many parameters that change locally over the melt
season. The heat cannot readily equilibrate because of diffusive and conductive
barriers but still manages to affect many processes.



The hycom image needs a click to display its thickness boxes. To make, I put a
one pixel dot right at the pole and put the color picker too on it there so
that it also highlighted the right box on the thickness palette, then cropped
the stack of co-screenshots.

What Polarstern photographs bring home is how limited is our understanding of
the state of arctic ice. Looking at Worldview the pole area looks like solid
ice without the clear bluing of melt ponds we see during early season surface
melt and yet 50% of this surface is actually melt pond. It is a good reminder
to us all of the limitations of satellite monitoring and how imprecise 25 km sq
or 3 km sq grids can be. It also clearly shows how hard getting accurate sea
ice area measurements are when even photographs from a few hundred meters are
hard to evaluate.

I would love to see a close photograph of one of those 'blue' sections of WV
images from earlier in the year - I assume it must actually look like a huge
lake of water on top of sea ice and not a 'pond'. Perhaps we need to refer to
them as lakes in future.

    way insufficient knowledge of current ice conditions

I looked into true polar orbits for dedicated radar satellites with no pole
holes: not gonna happen because the cost has to be spread out across many
planetary interest groups that want sun-synchronous. Almost all Arctic data is
derivative: older satellites on other missions that were later re-purposed for
ice (eg smos, smap from ag soils). Potentially wider swath technology on a
near-polar orbit makes more sense. Not happening any time soon enough.

It would be great if the PS shared a straight nadir overhead from their
helicopters. They took those photos yesterday for sure but chose not to share.
We could then overlay various grid scales to compare with the intrinsic scale
needed to capture key melt pond parameters. The PS provides an in-scene scale
of 117 m; the google earth type projection is easily rectified.

To me, the north pole photos sent a mixed message: wow the ice is really bad
but worse the scientific Emperors Have No Clothes. Perhaps that is why the ship
left the pole hole after only 9 hours on the scene, to change the subject. Yet
these pole photos are likely all that will be remembered from the year-long
cruise. There may never be a return visit by another R/V.
 
As you say, those bigfoot pixels are a serious mismatch with characteristic
dimensions of the object under study. There do exist multispectral satellite
methods for remotely determining melt pond depth (eg on Greenland) though again
how low has to be flown to capture any detail.

Mosaic ticker talks about June 26th melt ponds visible in Sentinel-2 optical
color, said to be 10 m. The initial image quality was mediocre but came out ok
after post-processing and 4x enlargement. The problem is the Arctic Ocean is
one of the cloudiest places on earth. It could take months to stitch up a
picture of melt ponds over the whole ocean, meaning these would have wildly
varying timestamps.

Do they have drones on the Polarstern? I wonder if they filmed miles of the

why are satellites so rubbish over the Arctic in 2020?

A-Team glad to see you back here. re the ice bottoms I would't expect them to
be very reflective because the refractive index ratio between the water and ice
will be very small compared to that between air and ice.
Seawater RI 1.34, ice 1.31
For normal incidence should be about 1% reflectivity as opposed to 4%, most of
the light will be refracted down.

A-Team, you bring sanity to our discussion, as always.

Just one quick question - your discussion of water adsorbtion of energy from
sunlight. I understand you to be implying that 100% pure water would be fully
transparent, something that seems to be the case in nuclear power station
cooling pools, see image.

So the albedo effect of water vs. ice is that water lets most of the visible
light radiation through so it can reach impurities in the water column, while
ice reflects most of this radiation, so only surface impurities catch any
light.

No binntho, you’re missing the fact that ice has a range of albedo values. It
can range from clear (black ice) to light gray, depending on how fast it
freezes, which affects how many air bubbles are in it.

So You seem to have it backwards, ice doesn’t have a high albedo like snow does
and doesn’t reflect a lot of light, it normally has a low albedo, so it
normally allows most of the light through, unless it has a lot of air bubbles
in it. A-Team was patiently explaining That the light that’s reflected from the
ice goes in all directions, not just back into space.

The end result is that ice at the bottom of a melt pond has a mid range albedo,
reflecting more than open water, but still transferring a lot more solar energy
to the water underneath than snow covered ice.

Arctic sea ice normally appears to be a medium gray, So a medium amount of
albedo, so if large areas of ice look like that photo from the PolarStern, then
even though there wasn’t a lot of open water in July, a much higher amount of
solar energy was transferred to the water underneath the ice than normal snow
covered ice with less melt ponds.

Ps - this discussion should be moved to a new thread if you really want to
carry it further.

I'm sorry but I don't agree at all with your explanation. And I am not "missing
any facts" just because I don't cover all angles and expound all caveats.

And your "ice doesn't have a high albedo like snow does" seems to be "missing
the fact" that snow is ... (tadah!)  ice! The rest is just rambling.

EDIT: This is off-topic, but I posted a very short question to A-Team in the
hopes that he would answer, and we could all avoid the bessenwisserschaft that
seems to fill too many of us to overflowing. So if anybody else wants to
answer, please take it elsewhere.

No, as I pointed out in a response to A-team submerged ice has an albedo of
about one quarter of open water.

The Polarstern has been at 87.7  104.2 for over nineteen hours, having settled
on a floe for the rest of Mosaic. The idea was to land on their previous track
to give a semblance of continuity. The new floe in reality will have a very
different history and basically nothing in common with the previous Fortress
floe, as can be seen by the precarious conditions setting up. Trackbacks in
late summer are very difficult unless the floe has distinctive features.

The ship was last nearby (87.5  103.6) on 15 Jan 2020. They are just north of
the area that can be imaged by Sentinel-1AB radar (ie in its pole hole) which
is unfortunate as there won't be optical WorldView with weather so bad the
helicopters can't fly.

There have been occasional Modis windows through the clouds though and a really
clear view from space is shown below for Aug 10th (as enhanced by uniq).The
resolution is just not there to capture details at the melt pond level.

Bow radar has not been turned back on. Today's 'Follow' photo though is quite
instructive. It shows quite degenerate late season ice with a variety of novel
platelets, melt ponds, sagging hummocks, open leads and so on, out to the
horizon but of a different character than the north pole seen. I'll locate it
in the next post on the most recent AMSR2_AWI.

I thought open water has an albedo around 0.1, so 90% absorption and submerged
ice is around 50, so 50% absorption. Open water absorbs about twice as much
energy as submerged ice.

That's correct, Rox. Those are the numbers given at NSIDC that I posted above.
The blue-green submerged ice is roundtrip incident light that makes a second
reflective pass out through the water to reach the camera. Really really clear
ocean water is actually not blue but purple (ROYGBV and all that.)

https://www.newscientist.com/article/
dn12162-found-the-clearest-ocean-waters-on-earth/

Wiki has a strong article on the the adsorption spectrum of liquid water and
ice. It has a faint but non-zero optical density in the visible that turns out
to be vibrational quanta related to the hydrogen bonding, ditto for ice which
has lattice adsorption as well.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_absorption_by_water

I cannot emphasize enough the importance of skimming through the scientific
literature on melt ponds. Nothing has changed with melt ponds over the decades
so older papers are still good.

There are literally thousands of peer-reviewed melt pond papers listed at
Google Scholar. Below are a few from 2020. No paywalls today, so no excuses if
that's something people really want to delve into, rather than just make stuff
up.

Maybe after assimilation, it would make sense to armchair intuit consequences
for the north pole area for the current melt season. I've been wondering what
happens if they never get around to draining and instead ice over for the next
winter (into next melt season).

The salinity would vary depending on brine pockets that got taken up in the
melt process but overall a lens results with quite different properties from
the residual ambient ice surrounding the melt pond.

Many properties of the floe would be affected in the next melt season. The PS
measured some of the melt ponds to a depth of 1.5m in ice of perhaps 2m. It is
difficult to estimate the encased liquid volume fraction from the pole photos
but it seems quite substantial. A whole field of melt ponds is a different
scenario from 1-2 in isolation.

Meanwhile, back at new AMSR2_AWI and old AMSR2_UHH, what do they see at the new
mooring location of the Polarstern? Not much, they do not have nearly the
resolution to see small melt ponds and leads. The re-colored palette of ice
under the red location star is entirely in the 99-100%.

Meanwhile the Polarstern is drifting away, currently 10-15 km off at 87.8 
104.9  at 17:00 today. The AMSR2 are both from the previous day but that isn't
a concern given the large consistent block. Hopefully the bow radar will be
reactivated soon and maybe they will take some visuals to go with it (haven't
since Nov 1st).

            The end result is that ice at the bottom of a melt pond has a mid
            range albedo, reflecting more than open water, but still
            transferring a lot more solar energy to the water underneath than
            snow covered ice.



        No, as I pointed out in a response to A-team submerged ice has an
        albedo of about one quarter of open water.


    I thought open water has an albedo around 0.1, so 90% absorption and
    submerged ice is around 50, so 50% absorption. Open water absorbs about
    twice as much energy as submerged ice.


Based on the physics the reflectivity of pure water is about 4% for vertical
illumination whereas the reflectivity of a submerged ice surface under water is
about 1%.
The absorption coefficient of red light is about 100 times that of blue light.

    The Polarstern has been at 87.7  104.2 for over nineteen hours, having
    settled on a floe for the rest of Mosaic. The idea was to land on their
    previous track to give a semblance of continuity. The new floe in reality
    will have a very different history and basically nothing in common with the
    previous Fortress floe, as can be seen by the precarious conditions setting
    up. Trackbacks in late summer are very difficult unless the floe has
    distinctive features.

There is nothing precarious in that floe in terms of thickness though. That’s
clearly much thicker than 2m. There is also the field of ice right behind that,
which, while hollowed by melt ponds, is clearly pretty thick as well, and will
make a decent base when everything freezes.

I’m concerned however by the strong winds forecasted for the next days. Things
may then show its precarious state.

Not any further scientific news from the Polarstern today. The bow radar is
still off. Their position continues to drift a bit under mild winds, currently
87.8  106.1  Aug 23 14:00 wind 6m/s from 200º. They are likely setting up a
slightly Dispersed Camp near the ship to get away from its diesel and ramming
impacts yet have reliable cables for data and electric. These caused endless
grief during the main cruise.

They have not doubt determined ice thickness by drilling a few spots and
weather permitting, helicopter and sled raster surveys. Hycom is showing the
ice in their area to be about 0.75m thick on Aug 19 and thinning to perhaps
0.65 m by the end of the month forecast period. They are in FYI formed off the
Laptev, not in older CAB ice.

Mosaic trip leaders prefer 1.0m or thicker floes for safety in severely decayed
and sometimes deceptive ice but that seems not an option near their current
position. Fog did not permit them to look around systematically for pressure
ridges that might vaguely approximate the long-gone initial Fortress site.

So far, the PS has not set down its gangplank. It's not clear from the one
photo we have where exactly it would go. The scientific equipment and
snowmobiles would be winched down in any case. The underwater ROV could be
launched right alongside the ship -- it does the underwater mapping of keels
and freeboard that is needed along with on-ice surveys to map ice thickness in
their area.

Snow? They've said it has snowed less than five times during the entire year.
It never layered up on regular ice but was entirely blown in the lee of
pressure ridges and the like. Rain, sun and warmth have probably obliterated
any remnants of that.

Having already lost many weeks of research time in the south and with freezing
season approaching, they settled in to the first workable site, focusing today
on implausible self-rescue by ice pick drills for everyone going out on the
very dangerous ice near the ship. The US Coast Guard has vastly higher safety
standards for the Healy (which recently had two diving deaths).

The drowning death this week of veteran Greenland researcher Konrad Steffen in
a well mapped, meltwater filled Greenland crevasse at Swiss Camp has surely
heightened risk awareness.

A-Team, to my untrained eye the ice where the poeple located and the ice in the
far background seems flat and less than a meter, the far background seems very
similar to the North Pole photo with all the melt ponds. However the ice in
between appears taller out of the water and bumpy, and could be a pressure
ridge remnant. I am also guessing they intentiinally picked a floe that was
much thicker than the typical meager floes in that region. I wonder if you read
this the same way.
(I refer to the wider image you provided in post #1013).

recent weather report from awi met

51 -- continuous light drizzle
28 -- fog
71 -- continuous light snow

water temp from sailwx still relatively high peaking at -1.4C. Probably lower
salinity allowing that rise, probably due to bottom melt

You'd think a national weather service would have mouse-overs to the acronyms.
Not rocket spreadsheet science to go through awiMet ship weather for the entire
cruse (7561 entries) and pull out all the ones with weather comments (396 of
them) sorted into class counts. So that's attached as a csv file below, ready
for uniq(?) to process them further along the lines above, eg how many foggy
days.

More challenging: go through the entire voyage on nullschool and do something
with their 3hr precip claims (3HPA) for the whole Arctic Ocean. Not make a 5
hour mp4 but more of a summary. Rain is just devastating to snow and ice
because of then phase change latent heat.
Quote

    Oren: ice doesn't look all that thick overall but maybe locally

Very reasonable interpretation of the photo (which is all we have to go on).

Earlier in the year, 'Follow' did post a couple of raster thickness maps from
above and below, in addition to near-horizontal mapping of topography. We have
those above somewhere; they unfortunately forgot to include the numerical
scale. Maybe this time they will!

The bow radar (above the upper bridge) just takes in surfaces reflections so
maybe roughness and open water but not thickness. They unfortunately forgot to
pair it with a camera or calibrate it with outings plus a Finnish student
mistakenly cropped away the whole instrument parameter display for the entire
cruise.

The ship sails with a electromagnetic doohickey suspended off the prow that
measured ice thickness (ie distance to saltwater) along the entire way from
Greenland north. That would not provide representative ice thickness since they
were always looking for a route involving minimal icebreaking. Be the same for
a time lapsed smart phone lashed to the mainmast.

To answer your question though, we are somewhat at cross-purposes with the
Polarstern.

The forums are terribly concerned with the current state of the ice ocean-wide,
learning about the mysterious ice conditions in the pole hole, mapping features
like melt pond extent below satellite resolution, getting spot measurements of
ice thickness to compare with piomas and hycom models, describing how the melt
season will end up, quantitating heat that will continue to be available into
the fall, and understanding how it all compares to the trends of previous
years.

Mosaic has a different agenda: trying to comply with the terms and objectives
described in their massive grant. These stress goals such measuring this and
that on the ice over a full year to improve interpretation of satellite imagery
that will monitor the ice in future years when no ship is out there.

Indeed those improvements may already surfaced in the new AMSR2_AWI as that PI
from leg 3 explained in a recent ticker. That's why we've dropped Hamburg and
Bremen, putting all the effort in understanding to the new product and perhaps
adding inclusivity and presentation value.

The ship is just a moving point on millions of sq km of ice; efforts to widen
the swath with remote deployments and buoy swarms have had mixed results.
There's been little mention of larger scale  ongoing sonar tomography that uses
the ship as passive receiving station. This would map out oceanographic detail
for the whole Nansen Basin top to bottom.

The PIs have said repeatedly that the top cruise priority now is documenting
the onset and mechanisms of early freeze season to complete the funding terms
of the mission. Since they moored on 04 Oct 2019, that probably means going out
a week at most to 12 Oct 2020 before heading back to Tromsø.

So in by way of providing us better understanding of the current melt season,
it will take some time (2023) before all the data can be corralled into print.
N-ICE2015 just put out another paper modeling AW as it was five years ago.

In fairness though, the 25 years of mooring studies through 2018 just published
by Polyakov et al are extremely relevant to the current melt season as the
slowly but inexorably shoaling Atlantic Waters is taking over the energy budget
from surface weather.

Will the lessons learned by the Polarstern still be relevant to the ice of that
day or fall more into paleo?

Given the pace of climate change, especially in the Arctic, chewing of cud
seems an unaffordable luxury. Darwin could spend 40 years polishing his snail
monograph but today we need something closer to near real time. New satellites
sound great but take years of planning to implement. Thus air-dropped buoys,
undersea gliders and transect-flying drones may be more the way to go.

Many years ago, the US military allowed civilian access to their GPS
satellties,
Many years ago the USAF allowed access to their DMSP satellites, and loa and
behold, the NSIDC we know today was born.
HYCOM is a US Navy operational product, with civilian access.

On the thread "Robots and AI: Our Immortality or Extinction" you can see how
the military have developed the use of AI + drones and undersea ROVs for
military objectives with disturbingly hgh rates of success. In today's
political climate, can we hope for the application of these AI systems and
hardware for peaceful purposes, e.g. looking at and measuring the cryosphere?

Civilian air-dropped buoys that anyone can purchase and deploy unregulated for
any reason were tabulated here earlier. Some 33 of them have been put out on
the Arctic Ocean in recent years. They report over iridium to open-source IADP
at UW.

University science gliders are out there already too in the Beaufort, doing
many thousands of km of surveys. This is a sawtooth path technology that makes
clever use of very slight buoyancy differences that take very slight amounts of
battery power to implement. They can surface from time to time to send data so
are an improvement in that sense over fixed moorings. These are not high tech
and any hobbyist could build one at home and launch it.

As Rod noted earlier, the PS likely has small drones that spare routine
helicopter tasks and their limited fuel. Such drones have been widely deployed
at glacier fronts in Greenland to make orthographic time series. Again,
something anyone could buy at ebay, launch themselves, and process and post the
data. In the US this is somewhat regulated and not allowed say at Grand Canyon
or over police and fire emergencies.

Now the larger drones capable of flying back and forth across the Arctic Ocean
with a lot of camera technology, that could be more of a problem in terms of
acquisition options, expense, transport, massive files and approvals. The Coast
Guard might very well want to partner with scientists on this for marine safety
reasons and given the short shelf life, what would be the reason for not
distributing it?

There is a lot of commercial air traffic over the Arctic now in normal times
but way above the cloud deck (though nobody seems to set a minimal altitude on
that).

Even the big ones are easy to fly over the internet and indeed all the US
drones in the Middle East are run down the road from me by young enlisted video
gamers. It might be simpler just to charter a small plane from Western
Aeronautics and have them shoot large format through the floor. Who is going to
stop you?

Here we spent $150m euros to get 9 hours at the North Pole during which we
learned we didn't know anything at all about ice conditions at high latitudes
from existing satellites, buoys or one-off cruises, ice tourism or adventuring.

No information at all today from Mosaic, get over it. Bow radar still not
working ... does that mean they need it for operations like looking around more
for a good floe? Mist and fog mean they cannot leave the ship because of the
polar bear visibility issue.

At 15:00 though, the wx staffer put visibility at 96 which is 4-10 km but fully
overcast at 8/8 and cloud deck 1 which is low, 50-100m overhead. Conditions are
only noted 4x a day, not hourly like position, wind, and temperature. There is
practically no wind, 1m/s (despite the storm that's been raging on the melt
forum). Wind is measured from a mast 38m above sea level.

FoMo is back to hugs and cherished memories from yet another well-paid
creature-comforted job-related cruise; Mosaic's main expedition page always
makes me feel I've stumbled onto a private TikTok party link rather than
public-funded climate change research site. In past decades, the Polarstern has
always posted a detailed weekly ship log.

We do learn however that the Polarstern skipped town without retrieving all the
expensive equipment left on dispersed Fram floes. However the chartered Russian
icebreaker Akademik Tryoshnikov did manage to pick some of it up. The rest will
sink to the bottom off Greenland's national park.

From wiki: Alexey Fyodorovich Tryoshnikov (Алексе́й Фёдорович Трёшников) was a
Soviet polar explorer, the leader of the 2nd Soviet Antarctic Expedition and
the 13th Soviet Antarctic Expedition and later a member of the Soviet Academy
of Sciences. He was involved in defending the Northern Sea Route during World
War II and participated in the 1948 Soviet expedition to the North Pole.
Between 1954 and 1955, he was the leader of the North Pole-3 ice station in the
Arctic Ocean.

weather update:
06:00    41 -- patches of fog
03:00    48 -- fog, depositing rime, sky visible

I suppose with poor visibility and treacherous ice there are few opportunities
for buoy deployment.

New buoys ... hopefully a lot of them. They are just laying out snowmobile
routes now for the semi-dispersed camps. The question is, would buoy-like
instruments report over fiber cables or a local LAN rather than Iridium in
which case the data would not show up online at IABP or meereis gallery.

Mosaic has various rules around wind speed, precipitation and visibility that
constrain helicopter flights. Right now wwWW is saying 0354 which is 'clouds
developing, drizzle, fog' with height saying very low clouds 50 to 100 m at
20-08-26 09:00 UTC. These are probably no-go for launches.

The 'Follow' photo for today shows two people filling in a melt pond with
shovel and digging bar against a background of heavy fog. Frankly it is not
possible to mount a bear guard under these conditions but maybe a double
electrified fence line has been set up.

Both have unzipped the top half of their safety suits despite 15 minutes
maximal survival time in -1.8ºC water. They could not possibly self-rescue with
all the weight of water immediately filling their suits. http://www.ussartf.org
/index.html

The two are not shoveling snow since there has hardly been any the entire year.
It looks more like quite rotten ice -- it would not be possible to make a dent
in solid ice with these tools. In any event, they need a level haul track to
get heavy gear and power lines out to the new off-ship observing center. Again,
we do not know the true date of this photo as others have been 3-4 days behind
despite a current time stamp.

Interesting minor project: take the awiMet weather lines, do the lookup of all
the codes, and replace them with the applicable weather text. MS Word has that
glossary feature built in.

It's not clear that new dispersed buoys would drift away from the Polarstern in
the short term. OsiSaf is showing a lot of purple arrows and grid cell
zero-movement dots, having given up entirely on the light blue periphery.

The bow radar has been turned off for a full week now (or at least not posted).
The last blurry scene was at 09:00 on the 19th. The ice is not likely to be
very mobile right now; it's not clear whether melt ponds can be distinctively
resolved from other ice features with this radar.

The field of view of the bow radar is about 500 pixels per 5000m so about the
same as Sentinel-2 which we haven't used much over the summer because of the
inconvenience of the portal and now clouds and diminishing sunlight. The new
AMSR2_AWI would have only 4 pixels to cover the bow radar scene, if you could
find them.

Note nh_20200826_21_SIC_72h.tiff has a long diagonal swath line almost like a
WorldView.

That last picture posted is certainly a bit strange. Could they be attempting
to discover the depth of the porous ice above whatever is left of the solid
ice? It appears the top of whatever they are standing on is about a meter above
the melt pond level. Temperature must be pretty warm for one to be bare armed
(or they are working very hard.)

A-Team, to me it looks like the 2 individuals might be shoveling some heavy
snow that’s gone through a few cycles of thaw/wetness and refreezing. Looks
similar to the snow here in the spring.

Plausible. Also they do have various snow plows on board and this material may
have been worked over already. They are also reporting fog and steady drizzle
which would affect snow appearance and properties. In today's staged photo, the
sled is not pushing any snow ahead of its horizontal member.

The only place experiencing massive Arctic snowfall this year was once again
the main forum. The Polarstern itself only reported 4-5 measurable snows. Those
were quickly redistributed into drifts in the lee of pressure ridges. The
Polarstern visited this spot back in mid-January but has not disclosed or
compared conditions.

We need to re-think snow cover impacts on the albedo and melt pond scenarios in
the face of observation. Also missing: rainfall data and air heat capacity
(fog).

Amazing that they were able to recover and re-build this flux sled. It really
got smashed up by floe motion a few months back. M Shupe posted a good story
about its rescue in the Fram:

https://blogs.agu.org/thefield/2020/08/17/
postcards-from-a-formerly-frozen-icebreaker-part-55/

They still are not posting the bow radar so it is difficult to assess local ice
motion today. The unofficial arrow points to a possible melt-through of the
melt channel. It is still quite foggy. That backpack and other items should
lashed to a small sled, not worn.

The Arctic Ocean is currently just that: over half is open water. The
simplified scene below is comprised (by pixel count) of 19% land, 42% open
water and 39% ice. Not counting land, the ratio of open water to ice of any
kind is 52:48.

OsiSaf today is coloring 37% of the ice pixels in light blue. This is the ice
most at risk from winds and bottom melt over the next month. Note the patch of
low concentration ice just below the pole. Persistence over multiple days needs
to be established; it is too cloudy for WorldView VIIRS to help.

The pace and style of old academia, as done by the Polarstern scientists is
failing us. By the time they get their results published those results will be
out of date. Yes, the basic science has not changed, but the ice conditions
have deteriorated over the past 3 years.

We are mostly flying blind on this forum, speculating or measuring
insignificant changes to infinitesimally diminishing significance.

I plead guilty to speculating about what's happening below the ice between
Greenland and the pole. The key factor was probably the unprecedented clear
weather and direct sunlight, but we need buoys down there recording what's
happening and we need real time analysis by knowledgeable scientists like
A-Team. I agree with him about the deployment of surface and below surface
instruments. Satellite measurements have limited capabilities as we can see
with our own eyes from the photos at the pole.

The Arctic is melting rapidly while the traditional scientists play their old
academic games. And the atmospheric circulation is shifting all the way up to
the upper stratosphere while they dither over which ice floe to moor on. (The
rapid jump in the QBO this summer is very unsettling.)

A few days of moderate surface winds are forecast at GFS, including easterlies
along the Beaufort, a large but moderate anti-cyclone on the Laptev, and a
commonly seen tight cyclone around Svalbard.

As a reminder, the bottom line is friction between local surface winds and ice
roughness (respectively water) is what moves today's ice (makes waves). What
the MSLP might be doing in the Azores over the next ten days, how the jet
stream pattern could change far above as a consequence of fractional BOE, and
whether ENSO will be trending in the eastern Pacific don't move ice. They might
ultimately drive big-picture wind but predicting it below 2m isn't even an
aspirational goal.

That friction is likely higher in the Beaufort because of exposed freeboard
edges of dispersed floes. Thus a few days of persistent easterly wind may push
much of what's left of the ice below the threshold of radar satellite
visibility towards the warmer Chukchi. Waves are always a factor in late season
but here long reach swells will not be a player.

The image below places these winds relative to the unfiltered 21:00 UTC of
AMSR2_AWI (v101/nh_20200827_21_SIC_12h.tiff) by deleting the five highest
palette ice concentrations (less likely to be affected by the winds) to let the
21:00 UTC of nullschool winds show through.

By changing the underlay, that could be visualized 2-3 days out but the problem
is that the AMSR2 concentration overlay has no forward map. The difference
between 24 hour 21:00's is already quite striking so the wind overlay on a
fixed 21:00 of Aug 27 would rapidly become inexact.

Hycom does offer a forward map so AMSR2 could somehow be morphed along to
follow its outline. More easily, the wind prediction could be shown behind
deleted hycom open water. As interstitial noted, hycom's edge is way too far
out. However those colors can be picked and filled with ocean gray.

The scale on nullschool was set to 2800 in its stereographic projection so
rescaling by 141% matches it to AMSR2_AWI.

Note this new AMSR2 is unique among products used on the forum in that it is
correctly constructed as an 8-bit color geo-located tiff, rather than 24-bit
png, jpg, or ever-changing 8-bit gif89. Tiff specs are defined on page 23 of
the 1992 defining document:

"Palette-color images are similar to grayscale images. They still have one
component per pixel, but the component value is used as an index into a full
RGB-lookup table." .

The particular tiff ColorMap used at AWI was laid out somewhere within the
bundled file package as an ordered 3-column RGB list; a Baseline tiff reader
such as ImageJ's then displays the color map tiles via the 'Edit Lut' command.

An ordinary full color image such as png can be changed to 8-bit color and
saved as tiff but it won't have an orderly ColorMap as it is simply made from
the highest frequency color usages. However as a csv file it can be sorted to
order and loaded as the working LUT.

A-Team - gorgeous image. Should this not be posted on the melt thread? Removing
the condensed central pack from the image clearly focuses the eye on not just
the areas which will be most affected by the winds, but also those areas most
likely to be most involved in extent and area changes.

I understand what you say about the Beaufort not developing long reach swells.
My question would be is the Laptev open water and a fairly prolong wind pattern
exposing that front to more of those long reach swells?

    UC: Laptev more exposed to swells in coming days? cross-post melt forum?

Right, ice in the western Laptev ice appears more at risk from swells than that
of the Beaufort though the latter is currently farther gone. The reach of the
wind there is potentially 800 km or more, the speed is gale force at 15 m/s in
places, the forecast calls for a few days of persistence, and the putative
swells would hit head on.

That combination seems more than enough for a significant or even dramatic
swell damage. While no one is out there to provide confirmation, if something
significant does come to pass on satellite, swells should certainly be
considered as candidate explanation. We don't have any real data on how common
major swell events are; reports are entirely serendipitous.

People are welcome to cross-post to other forums or anywhere else on the
internet -- and lay on their own interpretation. I recall that forum software
will re-display images and animations just from its url, as wrapped with a 2nd
row button above. The image does not need to be downloaded and re-uploaded.

There are two advantages to this: the image does not count towards the posting
limit of 4, it can be reside in the middle of a text sandwich where it fits
better rather than sit context-free on the bottom.

Below is a spectacular north pole ice photo I came across on a news site. It
could be placed in any number of forums. Actually I am just trusting the
caption; the photo is undated, has no lat lon nor  EXIF data. The Polarstern
was at the pole on August 19th but Folke Mehrtens may not be the actual
photographer as stated, she has been at the AWI's communications press office
since 2008.

The second photo is on AWI media twitter so presumably is at the north pole as
stated. It's very unfortunate that AWI does not put together a permanent
gallery of properly labelled, dated and credited North Pole photos -- these
will never be published or analyzed in a scientific journal but nonetheless are
an important part of the record.

So many generic stock photos are shown, including by AWI, that the public never
knows for sure when they are looking at the real thing.

    First we found a SIMB3 buoy bobbing amid little ice floes. Easy to just
    pluck this one up out of the water. Then the ocean flux buoy; this was much
    harder as it was still embedded in a small chunk of ice. The ship’s crew
    pumped ocean water on it to melt out around the base and then lifted it up
    and out of the water, followed by a tether below and additional instrument
    packages. I’m glad we recovered this system as we believe the next crew of
    scientists will be able to redeploy it during leg 5 to help get ocean heat
    flux measurements at this crucial time of year when the ice melt slows and
    eventually stops, giving way to another freeze up. On this day we did not
    get the ice tethered ocean profiling buoy, as it was nowhere to be found,
    but we have to call this a highly successful day nonetheless.

A question - Are you saying that the condition of the Jet Stream, at a point in
time, plays no significant part influencing and is unrelated to the Arctic
weather system forecasts?

So once again, a bogus caption on a photo? They were not anywhere near the Pole
on the 17th. Nor were they in the Fram but rather 86.8 12.3. Even the cheapest
flip phone records time of photo on the photo.

AWI does provide a photo database for media but access requires a login that

    Jet stream important influence?

Of course in the big picture it's all tied together, though to date we appear
no closer to reliable 5-day much less seasonal predictions than ever. Knowledge
of the jet stream does not lead useful prediction of the surface winds that
actually physically couple with the ice,.Especially this August, that would be
a big leap given the jet stream's complex and semi-chaotic structure.

Rain, fog, melt pond and snow distribution: terribly important to the ice but
where in the jet stream graphic (or any satellite product 42 years in) do I
find reliable data for them at the scale we need? We have to get some better
sensors out there; the Polarstern is not the answer.

Consequently, I would rather glance at nullschool 1000 hPa winds twice a day
rather than read ungrounded weather speculation on the melt forum. And that is
true too where I live, despite a full-time gov't Wx staff of seven, they cannot
get a half day ahead on weather specifics such as rainfall.

So yes, maybe we can usefully do 2-3 days forward but really after-the-fact
(yesterday) is the best option, if it is not a broad-brush climate forum. But
frankly, given the importance of Arctic sea ice to the global climate system,
the complete ignorance demonstrated on Aug 19th of the state of the north pole
regional ice makes me wonder what they've been putting in the models all these
years in place of observational fact. Having half the ice pack in melt pond
doesn't matter?

But even with weather facts in hand, the explanation can elude us. Search
'arctic amplification' at google scholar. The top hit is a 2006 paper by MC
Serreze and JA Francis called "The Arctic Amplification Debate". They could
write a second paper with that same exact title today. The phenomenon has been
under debate since 1969.

    Thanks A-Team for your analysis.


"By the time they get their results published those results will be out of
date"

So very, very true!!!

In my more recent postings I have directly stated or inferred that the
quantitative analysis of the science is inadequate; that scientists and policy
makers are failing to relate to the reality and provide the required
leadership.

"We are mostly flying blind on this forum"

Again, so very, very true!!!

There is much 'belly button gazing' going on. There is not much by way of idea
exchanges. If an attempt is made to open a debate on the 2020 Melting Thread
and its significance to future events, it is immediately swamped by postings
commenting about weather forecasts, images from space and reference to the
events of previous years; the comments are of interest but limited 'use'. Are
we just posting to move up to the next grade of membership or gain 'I like'
points?

Surely, the purpose of this forum and indeed the science is to 'inform' but
this now requires a new perspective based on qualitative assessment of the
reality but relative to the basic science. We now have to believe what we can
literally SEE is happening, not blindly rely on imprecise satellite information
and projections based on historical data.

We need to present reasoned opinions about when the Arctic ocean will become
ice free and think creatively to stimulate new avenues of exploring events. Or
do we passively report and comment on current events? Do we agree with the
latest science indicating that we could see an Arctic ocean free of summer ice
by 2035? Is it possible for the Arctic ocean to be ice free in summer and
winter by 2035? Will the progress to ice free events be transitional or abrupt?
Will Atlantification prevent ice from reforming after a consecutive summer/
winter BOE? Are we not now at the time when informed opinion is of greater
value than the science to inform policy makers?

IMO we have run out of time for the science; science is still trying to catch
up explaining the history of events.

As I have said before, the science will still be projecting  that the Arctic
will be free of ice 10 years after the event at worse or confirming the Arctic
is ice free on the date of the event at best. We do not need the science for
either of these two 'scientific' outcomes.

Not sure to which thread this rant should be posted.

+1 just for telling it as it is

    Shupe posts a whole lot better information than AWI, also posts lectures

Right. Cires, AGU, Helmholtz, Ticker and scattered Twitter have provided
occasional blog information of much better quality than the upbeat censored
drivel coming out of AWI's Follow. It is most odd that these outside resources
are scarcely mentioned or promoted on the Mosaic site.

Of the 600 scientists involved no more than 5-6 have made any effort whatsoever
to communicate what really goes on in Polarstern research.

Mosaic is not interested in the current melt season or characterizing the
overall state of the ice. The focus initially was directed entirely to a highly
atypical pressure ridge, since disintegrated, that they settled on in
desperation last October. That's been replaced by a one-off pressure ridge in a
sea of melt ponds that cannot possibly provide year-long continuity.

The ship, in effect a gigantic polluted buoy, made good efforts to widen its
swath of observation but even close-in, unexpected ice mobility made it all but
impossible to keep equipment running and reporting. We have a good idea of
overall drift from buoys but the bow radar picture of floes jostling and leads
opening has not returned. This radar, essential to ship operations, is in good
repair, just not being shared.

Another camper was killed by a three year old male polar bear in Svalbard. His
mother and more recent cubs had recently been airlifted out of town. The victim
was actually the manager of the barren Dutch facility and in his second season
there. Six other campers witnessed the pre-dawn attack and were said
hospitalized for shock.

The presence of two bears and persistent fog at the current location raise a
number of issues about how researchers are being protected away from the ship;
in the early months of the cruise, safety was taken very seriously.

Whilst I broadly agree with the points you raise I must also plead guilty to
posting "images from space" in the 2020 Melting Season that reference "the
events of previous years", not to mention "the ice between Greenland and the
pole".

Another good source of information is the preprint page at The Cryosphere,
conveniently reverse chronological.  A third Mosaic paper recently appeared
there along with yet another from the predecessor cruise N-ICE2015. Overall
though, a majority of Arctic sea ice papers are not based on either expedition.

https://tc.copernicus.org/preprints/preprints.html

Surface-Based Ku- and Ka-band Polarimetric Radar for Sea Ice Studies
J Stroeve et al

Experimental evidence for a universal threshold characterizing wave-induced sea
ice break-up
J Voermans et al
https://tc.copernicus.org/preprints/tc-2020-201/tc-2020-201.pdf

Waves can drastically transform a sea ice cover by inducing break-up over vast
distances in the course of a few hours. However, relatively few detailed
studies have described this phenomenon in a quantitative manner, and the
process of sea ice break-up by waves needs to be further parameterized and
verified before it can be reliably included in forecasting models.

In the present work, we discuss sea ice break-up parameterization and
demonstrate the existence of an observational threshold separating breaking and
non-breaking cases. This threshold is based on information from two recent
field campaigns, supplemented with existing observations of sea ice break-up.
The data used cover a wide range of scales, from laboratory-grown sea ice to
polar field observations. 

Trends and spatial variation in rain-on-snow events over the Arctic Ocean
during the early melt season
T Dou et al
https://tc.copernicus.org/preprints/tc-2020-214/

Rain-on-snow (ROS) events can accelerate the surface ablation of sea ice, thus
greatly influencing the ice-albedo feedback. However, the variability of ROS
events over the Arctic Ocean is poorly understood due to limited historical
station data in this region. In this study early melt season ROS events were
investigated based on four widely-used reanalysis products (ERA-Interim,
JRA-55, MERRA2 and ERA5) in conjunction with available observations at Arctic
coastal stations.

Our results show that ERA-Interim better represents the onset date of ROS
events in spring and ERA5 better represents the phase change of precipitation
associated with ROS events. All reanalyses indicate that ROS event timing has 
shifted to earlier dates in recent decades (with maximum trends up to -4 to -6
days/decade in some regions in ERA-Interim), and that sea ice melt onset in the
Pacific sector and most of the Eurasian marginal seas is correlated with this
shift.

There has been a clear transition from solid to liquid precipitation, leading
to more ROS events in spring, although large discrepancies were found between
different reanalysis products. In ERA5, the shift from solid to liquid
precipitation phase during the early melt season has directly contributed to a
reduction in spring snow depth on sea ice with the largest contribution in the
Kara-Barents Seas and Canadian Arctic Archipelago.

A-Team, that first graphic in #1038 is excellent.  You'd get an A in graphics
art class with that one.  A lot of information presented very clearly.  You
earn a golden spyglass for peering through the fog.

uniquorn - interesting to see the divergence in drift between the southern most
buoy heading in the general direction of the Fram, the second buoy headed
perhaps toward the Nares or CAA and the others headed more toward the Beaufort.
Those are of course pretty close to the prevailing current wind patterns, but
the southern most buoy may be in more neutral wind and simply following 'least
resistance' as more southerly ice is being pulled toward the Fram.

The axib buoy was roughly 86N. Will run the iabp data and see how it compares.
Most things north of Greenland end up in the Fram.

Here is the T78 thermistor string data. Perhaps it was deployed in a frozen
melt pond.

    Quote from: D-Penguin on August 29, 2020, 05:27:39 AM

        If an attempt is made to open a debate on the 2020 Melting Thread and
        its significance to future events, it is immediately swamped by
        postings commenting about weather forecasts, images from space and
        reference to the events of previous years.


    Whilst I broadly agree with the points you raise I must also plead guilty
    to posting "images from space" in the 2020 Melting Season that reference
    "the events of previous years", not to mention "the ice between Greenland
    and the pole".
    oooooooooooo   0000
    What's not to like?

Absolutely nothing wrong. I find most of the comments, graphics and references
interesting and informative. I just lament the lack of extended debate about
the relativity and connectivity of current event postings to future events.

Perhaps, as an example, more comments about the picture you posted; why, how it
relates to the present situation and what next?

I remember the 'old days' on the ASI Blog when a debate (exchange of ideas) on
a particular topic might extend over a period of days or even weeks with a
number of different contributors. The debate ended with either a consensus view
having developed, an agreement to disagree or if the debate became acrimonious
Neven would diplomatically end it with a few well chosen words.

I do not know how to re-post my postings to a more appropriate thread but the

thickness update from T78 (88N). Near surface temps above zero since aug25/26. 
Possibly some bottom melt during that time.
note: lat/lon shown here is from the temp_proc file which often gives strange
numbers. When plotting locations it is best to use the TS file.

It seems like about ~5 thermistors or 10cm of bottom melt over 6 days, which my
intuition says is quite considerable for this date and latitude.

Agreed, it looks like ~10cm, here is a close up. Maybe it's more ablation than
melt.

More bottom melt.
Another 6cm? Needs confirmation tomorrow.
maybe 4cm

I'm surprised by the data from T78. Thermistors 85-94 dropped to -1.5C in the
last two days. That's 18cm. It's unclear from temperature alone whether this is
ocean or 'rotten ice' but a few more days data should verify which is which.
It could be a good thing if the ice is cooling.

Juilenne Stroeve's research which is trying to use 2 satellite radar bands to
separate measurements of snow depth and ice thickness makes sense, but it looks
like the Polarstern took off at a critical time for studying the melting of
snow and the beginning of melt pond season this spring.

This is a very frustrating story. My key take from it was, based on the photo,
there was very little snow. What ever, they pretty much wasted the scientist's
time as far as I can tell.
https://www.meereisportal.de/en/mosaic/driftstories/
driftstory-07-the-importance-of-the-first-snowball/

A first taste of spring

The turning point came on 19 April in the form of a brief but massive inflow of
warm air into the Central Arctic. Within the space of a day, the air
temperature at the snow’s surface in the MOSAiC Ice Camp rose from minus 7.4
degrees to minus 0.2 degrees Celsius. The warm spell only lasted 24 hours, but
it was enough to make a lasting change in the snow layer. “The warm air at the
snow’s surface immediately brought the top third of the snow layer up to the
melting point,” reports the scientist. Afterwards the entire snow layer froze
again. But by that point, the warmth had already left its mark on the snow. “We
assume that, in this brief warm phase, the first of many large snow crystals
began to melt, changing their shape and becoming smaller, even though we
couldn’t yet see these changes in detail in the overall snow cover,” says
Arndt.

The only thing that could be seen with the naked eye was a clearly recognisable
glazed layer. “From above, the snow looked as if the entire area was starting
to melt. But in fact, following the inflow of warm air, the surface refroze and
became reflective like a mirror,” the researcher reports.

The opportunity to personally experience such a warm spell in the Central
Arctic was the highlight of the spring for Stefanie Arndt and the other
researchers on board Polarstern. All the research groups intensified their
measurements in order to document the effects of this event at all levels –
from the atmosphere to the ocean. But it soon became clear: it would take more
than just a brief influx of warmth to set off the melting season in the Central
Arctic. It would take a special event – which occurred almost four weeks later,
on 12 May.

This all sounds interesting except that anyone who has ever lived in a cold
region for a winter knows that you can't form a snowball in cold dry snow. It
doesn't take a physicist. That said, it all goes south from that point.
Literally.

When the floes turn greyFreshly fallen snow crystals possess a multitude of
tiny surfaces and edges. These reflect the sun-light so that to observers the
snow layer appears white. But when the snow becomes warmer, the heat causes the
various microstructures to melt into each other. The edges become rounder and
the crystals clump together, creating sticky snow that can be formed into
snowballs. “If this process continues for two to three days, the previously
white snow turns grey, since the altered optical properties mean that it no
longer reflects the entire spectrum of the sun’s rays. Instead, it absorbs more
and more sunlight, causing the snow to become warmer and to melt further from
within. It collapses and becomes wetter, turning into grey slush, and forming
the first puddles of meltwater in depressions on the sea ice,” explains
Stefanie Arndt.The onset of melting on the sea ice in spring also marks the end
of the AWI ice-thickness meas-urements using the CryoSat satellite. When the
snow is wet, the satellite’s radar signal is no longer reflected clearly
enough. The researchers then have difficulty determining on the basis of the
measurement data whether the signal has been reflected by a snow-and-ice layer,
or by open wa-ter. They therefore discontinue the measurements during the
summer.Unfortunately, in the third and fourth weeks of May, Stefanie Arndt was
only able to observe the beginning of the snow melting from on board
Polarstern. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, during this key phase for the
sea-ice physicists the ship was on her way to Svalbard for a personnel
rota-tion. By the time the ship returned to the MOSAiC floe, it was already
mid-June.

Oops. In this case the Polarstern did not even serve as a giant polluted buoy.
It went south at an absolutely critical time and abandoned what ever research
might have been done. I feel sorry for the scientist in this story.

T78 thickness update. There is still liquid water in the melt pond. Perhaps
those 16cm at the bottom are rotten ice after all, or the salinity has dropped
further. The temperature gradient is quite sensitive to surface temperature.
It's probably not isolation this far north.

    I feel sorry for the scientist in this story.

All is not lost FOoW, we have 2 new snow buoys, S106 and S107

and a new thermistor buoy T81 which shows similar variable temperatures at the
ice/ocean interface.

drift update showing the new buoys. All the buoys north of 87N are heading for
the CAA at the moment. P229 probably drifting to the Fram. click for motion

A closer look at the S and T buoys. S107 is about 460m from PS

Once the ambient air temps get cold enough to not destroy our (imperfect)
algorithm, ill update the code and start posting those thickness figures we
were able to produce during the spring season

    T78, nearest to PS, has been deployed on ice ~1.5m thick (~therm30-105).
    Nice to see some below zero air temps there.


Really appreciating seeing actual experimental depth profile data, and very
well presented, thanks uniquorn.

The top of the ice is easy to find. But what about the bottom?

I see the temperature remains constant with depth below thermistor 105. Is that
definitive?

If it was just one snapshot at a fixed time then the profile could be
consistent with some sort of 'freshwater lens' effect, where the gradient was
due to increasing salinity with depth. So the actual boundary would not be
definitive.

But is it because the gradient above 105 wiggles up and down slightly in time -
indicating the better thermal conductivity of ice than of liquid water [UPDATE:
ice is 2.2, liquid is 0.6 in MKS units -- not as big a ratio as I had thought],
and so reacting more quickly to changes in air temperature - so it must be ice
rather than water down to 105 and there is no freshwater lens to be seen at
this location?

I think I have just convinced myself. Does that correspond to the actual
physics as known by those familiar with this equipment?


Do any of these rigs ever show a freshwater lens below the ice? If not, is that
not a real phenomenon in the Arctic?

It is very easy to detect and perceive the bottom of the ice in the winter/
spring due to the temperature gradient being positive from the top of the
thermistor column to the bottom (very cold air: cold ice: warmer ocean).

Between us were setting the ice:ocean thermistor at the -1.8 to -2degC mark.

Unfortunately, during summer this temperature gradient becomes a U-shaped
quadratic (warmer air: colder ice: warmer ocean) and eventually normalises to
close to 0, which basically creates hell for analysis. Particularly given that
the transition between ice and ocean at the bottom is probably muddied by
supercooled water.

(the 2nd and 3rd figures represent different thermal conductivity sensors, you
can just about perceive the bottom of the ice through summer)

Simon

May I ask what the scale on the left is?

I'm really struggling to see where the base of the ice is!

Would the winter ice be more clearly defined as the freeze causes mixing, the
water convecting below the ice layer? As the ice melts the heat is transferred
by conduction, leading to a much smoother gradient.

Each value on the left is 2cm (there are sensors in a column every 2cm), so the
difference between thermistor50 (Th50) and thermistor150 (Th150) is 1metre.

Heres a very quick image showing you the bottom (and why the temperature method
wont work when its warm above the ice):

Finally, some ice thickness data at the new floe: 1.40 to 1.70 range from 30
ice cores near the ship. They are staying close by this time because of set-up
time and past instability of remote floe sites.

It can be seen that Hycom is way off the mark, showing ice thickness of 0.7m
and nothing even resembling observation within 500 km. However the forecast of
ice motion over the coming week could still be on target.

NOAA-PSL is right on the mark with the correct thickness and an interesting
shape for it. They use a goofy coordinate system with elliptical latitudes and
curved meridians that is provincially AK-centric which cannot be rotated and
rescaled to match conventional polar stereographic that everyone else uses. No
netCDF is furnished. It has been like this for years; the site is unattended.

The tides and tidal currents at the current location are completely negligible.
The issue for a solid week has been a strong persistent wind off Siberia that
is quite noticeably moving the whole ice pack towards Banks Island. These winds
can induce semi-diurnal near-inertial waves in the water that the public
relations lady may be confusing with weak M2 lunar tides.

The photo shows decaying ice in an advanced state of melt. Freezing season is
still several weeks off (especially in this non-stop fog) though one day they
had to hand-skim ice off a melt pond in order to lower instruments.

It's hard to get Arctic field research to adhere to any kind of plan. Mosaic
has just had one bad thing happen after another, from not being able to find a
suitable floe back in October, unexpectedly rapid TransPolar Drift, seven weeks
lost in a resupply snafu, time and sensors wasted in the Fram, abandoned
instruments lost to ice motion, more resupply and repositioning delays and the
most scientifically damaging of all, loss of the Polar5 and Polar6 spring and
summer overflight campaigns.

https://tinyurl.com/y5dyk83u press release

Had these synergistic transects been flown (for atmospheric measurements,
pressure ridge and melt pond lidar and ice thickness) the swath of the
Polarstern would have been greatly widened. However the Svalbard airport was
shut down to non-Norwegian aircraft until just a few days ago. A fall campaign
has been started; no information is available on number and routes of flights.

Arguably, the most important thing the Polarstern has done is set out more
buoys along its route over and beyond the north pole. While some types of buoys
can be air-dropped, others need to be set into place after drilling and
confirmed to be working as designed (ie not going sideways through fractures in
pressure ridge as was seen in underwater ROV scenes).

Quite a few buoys are currently active in the Arctic Ocean basin, mainly from
non-Mosaic projects. Uniq has located a lot of them and plotted their recent
drift paths; those are put onto yesterday's AMSR2_AWI below.

The buoy map can only be produced currently relative to the 0 meridian so the
Greenland-down AMSR2_AWI has to be rotated 45º. Only the final frame of Uniq's
gif is shown. The trick in producing readable text in the overlay is combining
'darken only' over the ice and 'lighten only' over open water.

It's difficult to apportion ice pack edge changes on the Barents side into melt
and movement contributions.  No question, lateral melt momentum has been going
on steadily for months but per GFS nullschool, persistent and consistent winds
are blowing the whole ice pack towards Alaska.

The PS has been stably moored to its current floe since Aug 23 (after leaving
the pole on the 19th). This floe has drifted north and east (larger lat and
lon) since then. Over the last 11 days, the ship has moved 89.5 km for a speed
of 0.324 km/hr without any indication of dimensional melt or compaction in its
vicinity.

Presumably the ice edge has been moving north at an even faster nominal rate
because of contribution of disappearing peripheral melt there. However
subtracting two small numbers of pixel displacements is fraught with error.

The Polarstern is just one point. OsiSaf potentially offers speeds of ice
passing by all its grid points. Below, I isolated one grid cell close to the
ice edge and chained up arrows over 8 days to get displacement there. The data
comes with a 3x vector exaggeration. It is shown together with a display of
ship GPS on google earth, jagged because Mosaic cuts off 3 dp from what it
shares.

Note this melt season will have exceeded 53% BOE for over a month this year
(based on pixel counts on a non-equal area projection). The associated loss of
planetary refrigeration is discussed quantitatively in K Pistone et al 2019
"Radiative Heating of an Ice-Free Arctic Ocean":
Quote

   
    • The complete disappearance of Arctic sea ice would contribute an
    additional solar radiative heating of 0.71 W/m2 to the planet, equivalent
    to the radiative forcing from one trillion tons of CO2 emissions

    • The added solar heating from complete Arctic sea ice loss would be an
    order of magnitude larger in the month of May than in the month of
    September

Great stuff A-Team.
While the core measurements are perhaps surprising, the fact that it took them
quite a while to find a 'marginally good' flow to anchor to suggest to me that
this flow may be an exception to the surrounding ice?

It is of course the issue with any measurements being physically taken anywhere
but especially in such a mobile arctic ice pack - can it be extrapolated to an
area much greater than the point at which it has been taken. Is this flow
indicative of this section of the pack or it is exceptional. And with their
stated limited area of measurements, it is more problematic than their earlier
anchor flow.

Searching for a "good location to work on" is an extremely high bias. As before
they searched for a location with thick enough ice to work on. They were
looking for a while and settled on some ice thinner than they wanted. So they
didn't waste more time. This was not a random sample. We should not expect
models to predict random anomalies. It should predict systemic anomalies but
not random ones.

Indeed. The claim that Hycom is "way off the mark" needs clarification. How
long did it take them to find a floe thick enough for their needs? If the
surrounding ice is made up of 1.5 meter thick large floes, how did Polarstern
get there? I see nothing here that invalidates Hycom's estimate of 0,7m in this
area.

I'm still digesting your replies & my understanding of the physical situation -

You are going too far here Oren. What was so antagonistic other than that I
dared to point a critical finger at A-Team?

I wrote a well considered and well written comment worth reading and sharing.
If A-Team insists in making sweeping statements and not bothering to defend
them, then I suggest that you start snipping him.

The issue raised in the original post is that NOAA-PSL and Hycom models are
making incompatible statements about regional ice thickness. One (or both) of
them has to be wrong. DMI, Piomas and other thickness products do not make
forward predictions and were not considered for reasons given many times by
Oren.

Based on the brief and erroneous statement from the publicist back in
Bremerhaven, 30 ice cores were collected and frozen for later lab studies.
These ranged around 1.55m with very little scatter (10%), very similar to
NOAA-PSL but well out of Hycom range.

Reading between the lines, the cores were collected at regular intervals along
a transect: the newly established road system which goes out on level ice
perhaps a km from the ship to sensor stations. Photos so far do not show
notable ice jumbles or pressure ridges; cores there would be far more difficult
to obtain and much thicker than reported. Melt ponds are not cored.

Mosaic has provided no information whatsoever about the site selected other
than it had a lot to do with the time crunch of late arrival, match-up with
their January drift location, floe stability and safety (0.7 m or more is
sought). FYI, SYI, MYI ice? Nothing has been said about floe backtracking
history.

Persistent thick fog may have prevented helicopter launch and so the taking of
overhead photos. They did launch a drone but nothing from it has been shared.
We do not know at this time whether melt ponds and rotten ice are as pervasive
as at the North Pole.

How representative are these core thicknesses? Mosaic has seven methods for
accurately measuring ice thickness: en route bow/side em, helicopter-flown
em-bird, Polar 6 em-bird, sled em sensor, drilling for buoys, hole excavating
for oceanography, and coring for biogeochemistry.

The first four can add up to tens of thousands of km of accurately determined
ice thickness along swaths and rasters. None of this data has been disclosed
nor will be disclosed prior to 2023. Mosaic did release various over and under
camp maps for the first floe in November but in no case were thickness scales
included or maps updated over the drift.

In summary, they have considerable context for the 30 core thicknesses but we
do not. It's terribly naive to think site bias wasn't mitigated (how could they
wring a publication out of the data?)

These models are not entirely ab initio physical theory but rather
semi-empirical: before each day's recalc they are fed fresh weather, surface
temperatures, ice edge location, ice concentration etc. Consequently they
always get the current shape and overall drift of the ice pack correct as it's
baked in.

Unobservable fields such as frictional drag of surface to wind and keels to
ocean water can be inferred from observed response to recent wind. Indeed
NOAA-PSL has separate graphics for them; Hycom provides rolling 30 days of
which 24 are history that inform the 6 days of future.

In winter, they could (but don't) validate against SMOS/SMAP etc. However in
summer months they have no sources of observed ice thickness to assimilate
(though Polarstern weather and perhaps some buoy data is used right away in
ECMWF). Consequently, the models have no way to control drift in thickness
accuracy (except where it melts out to zero) until the fall sensor reset.

We do not run 'operational' forums here so rather than focus on futile
forecasting, we can simply wait a week, see actually happens and try to
understand why. However it does look like the persistent Siberian winds that
began on Aug 23rd will continue a few more days and even worsen on Sept 6th,
https://tinyurl.com/y64busr6

Damaging swells remain on the table but so far no evidence for impacts on the
ice pack has surfaced. The Beaufort arm is losing its loop but a patch may hold
on through the season; the sheltered ice south of SevZem is finally
dissipating.

The main story though changes in daily bulk movement of the ice pack to a
squeeze against the CAA with reduced transgression on the Barents side. Hycom
sees that as continuing through Sept 10th. We can revisit that prediction with
AMSR2_AWI and Polarstern track at the time.

For now, from uniq's efforts, we have very accurate records of regional ice
movement at the positions of ~50 individual buoys (these are sparse on the
Siberian side). Buoys near the Polarstern show its track and recent variations
in speed are shown below with 4 dp GPS precision. It can be followed loosely on
the awiMet hourly report site.

I suspect that all of the thickness models are wrong. PIOMAS is apparently
wrong on the high side between Greenland and the pole. HYCOM is apparently
wrong on the low side near the pole and probably in many other areas as well.
And MOSAIC is giving us the mushroom treatment on the thickness measurements
that they have made. Thanks, A-Team for parsing what MOSAIC's PR said between
the lines. The confusion here was pretty much inevitable given the poor
reporting by MOSAiC's PR officer. [A-Team quoted in blue]

I have no doubt that research papers will take appropriate steps to mitigate
site bias or it won't be relevant. I am in no way saying their research will be
faulty. I expect good research.
We do not have any research from the mosaic team yet only vague comments on
what they are doing. When they say they are looking for a place that is thick
enough to work on the ice safely that ice will be thicker than typical. I am
sure they have good data on typical ice thickness but we do not. Once their
paper are published we will have a much better information. If the purpose of
those cores is to report on typical ice thickness I will be wrong. I was not
aware of these cores. I don't know the purpose of their research. They could be
choosing the thickest ice to measure for a reason. They may be interested in
the evolution of ice that survives longer and want thicker ice. They could be
looking for ice that shows ridging or a million other things.

than average flow. They would not have to look for it if it was typical. The
captain said he wanted 1.2 meter or thicker ice for safety. At least that was
what someone wrote on one of these threads.

I was quoting A-Team in blue or teal. I have been watching thickness models for
years and I'm not convinced that any of them are accurately describing what has
been happening to the Arctic sea ice. Hycom drops too quickly from 2m to 1m
thickness, then takes forever to melt out. Of course, it all ends up corrected
with the ice is completely melted out. PIOMAS makes the ice too thick between
Greenland and the pole. The DMI model hasn't stood up to scrutiny here and I
have spent little time with it. I haven't looked at the NOAA thickness model
enough to comment.

Maybe the MOSAiC reports will end up in improved thickness models in 5 years.
Maybe we'll have a blue ocean event in 5 years. What ever, I find the interface
between the MOSAiC group and the rest of us to be unsatisfactory. Thanks to
Uniquorn for plotting up the buoy data. That's helpful.

The time series below looks at how the moored Polarstern responded to the
long-running mild anti-cyclone from Aug 23rd on to Sep 4th, with speed and
displacement determined from floe buoys by Uniq and applied wind stress
provided by GFS-nullschool three times a day.

There's quite a bit of hourly variation in wind details so the PS drift is
correspondingly complex, though the 122 km of net displacement is surprisingly
uniform in direction. Thus predicting overall motion of the ice pack (or just
shape of ice edge) is difficult even with a good weather forecast since neither
ridge nor keel drag is known nor ice plasticity response to pressure.

As first shown, the wind series was reversed relative to drift time. This
effect arises from gimp and imageJ using opposite time ordering conventions.
The last frame shows a major directional shift in the wind, now down from
central Siberia over the NSI, rather than curling down from SevZem as it has
been doing.

We tend to see wind speeds of 20 or 30 km/hr and imagine both immediate effect
on ice and immediate response to fluctuations similar to how a small boat would
respond in a lake. The reality is that the keel of an ice flow is huge, its
wind profile is small, and its gross weight is significant. It takes prolonged
consistent wind to create motion and build any speed and once that motion is
started, the mass of the flow creates a momentum that will maintain similar
speed through wind speed fluctuations.

Add to that most flows, and certainly the one the Polarstern is anchored to,
are not located in open water but in close proximity to thousands of other
massive flows - such a huge field that the winds affecting more distant flows
may be completely different from those in closest proximity.

In fact given the obstacles to consistent speed and direction, the consistency
exhibited by the buoys is quite impressive.

(Hadn't thought about this before, but the Polarstern must be creating quite a
sail for the flow it is anchored to. It might represent 100% more wind
resistance even to a very large flow. And I gues it is also creating a
significant keel as well - 11.2m/40')

Mosaic itself provides only the sketchiest details of the expedition written
from the perspective of a future large format coffee table book. On past
voyages, the Polarstern always posted a very informative weekly ship's log.

About 1% of the 600 scientists involved have supplemented 'Follow Mosaic' with
blogs and twitter commentary, most notably the co-originator M Shupe. He posts
quite regularly to the AGU and Cires sites, though often with a month's delay
with undated pictures by others from the AWI photo gallery. The most recent is
8/4/20 but that was written on 9/17/20. He also posts youtubes that are
basically zoom lectures on clouds, boundary layer processes and ice (not
watched).

I extracted items of scientific interest from the AGU posts into 11 dense pages
in the text attachment below, leaving out musings and miscellany. He is quite a
good writer and openly discusses various problems they've had with abandoned
and crushed equipment, lost data, flag litter, dirty ice (pebbles), lost weeks
resupplying, and idling in the Fram. The blogs give a good sense of what it is
like to be on such an expedition (minus inter-personal shipboard interactions).

Low-level mixed-phase clouds in a complex Arctic environment
R Gierens S Kneifel MD Shupe K Ebell M Maturilli U Löhnert
Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics doi: 10.5194/acp-20-3459-2020

Low-level mixed-phase clouds (MPCs) are common in the Arctic. Both local and
large-scale phenomena influence the properties and lifetime of MPCs. Arctic
fjords are characterized by complex terrain and large variations in surface
properties. Yet, not many studies have investigated the impact of local
boundary layer dynamics and their relative importance on MPCs in the fjord
environment.

In this work, we used a combination of ground-based remote sensing instruments,
surface meteorological observations, radiosoundings, and reanalysis data to
study persistent low-level MPCs at Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, for a 2.5-year period.
Methods to identify the cloud regime, surface coupling, and regional and local
wind patterns were developed. We found that persistent low-level MPCs were most
common with westerly winds, and the westerly clouds had a higher mean liquid
(42 g m−2) and ice water path (16 g m−2) compared to those with easterly winds.

The increased height and rarity of persistent MPCs with easterly
free-tropospheric winds suggest the island and its orography have an influence
on the studied clouds. Seasonal variation in the liquid water path was found to
be minimal, although the occurrence of persistent MPCs, their height, and their
ice water path all showed notable seasonal dependency. Most of the studied MPCs
were decoupled from the surface (63 %–82 % of the time).

The coupled clouds had 41 % higher liquid water path than the fully decoupled
ones. Local winds in the fjord were related to the frequency of surface
coupling, and we propose that katabatic winds from the glaciers in the vicinity
of the station may cause clouds to decouple.

We concluded that while the regional to large-scale wind direction was
important for the persistent MPC occurrence and properties, the local-scale
phenomena (local wind patterns in the fjord and surface coupling) also had an
influence. Moreover, this suggests that local boundary layer processes should
be described in models in order to present low-level MPC properties accurately.

    It takes prolonged consistent wind to create motion and build any speed and
    once that motion is started, the mass of the flow creates a momentum that
    will maintain similar speed through wind speed fluctuations.

The rule of thumb is ice pack speed is 1% of a consistent wind speed. Those
speeds and headings are listed (in m/s) for the whole expedition off a 38 m PS
pole at sailwx or awiMet below. Pressure ridge keels erode very rapidly under
water and would provide much less hydrodynamic drag now than initially. The
opposite is true for late season aerodynamic drag in FYI.
 
This in not the idealized ice puck skating down a frictionless hockey rink —
Newton’s first law does not apply, the pack quickly comes to rest if the wind
dies down or reaches a terminal velocity if it persists.

Considerations of whole-pack cohesiveness (mechanical strength, center of mass,
torque, rotation, deformability floe interdependence) come into play. Yet Uniq
as notes on the melt forum "there's still some low concentration areas beyond
the ice edge despite the constant 'compressional drift' [that evidently isn't
happening even after 12 days].

The Polarstern is indeed a massively overwhelming sail that with winds abeam
can rip out the six ice anchors and send the ship crashing through thinner ice,
as the captain discussed at the October mooring.

The remarkable consistency is in direction, not so much in speed. The latter is
quite variable and may have just sub-diurnal periodicity. As to your proposed 
sluggish response to changes in wind, can that be shown from the data for
2020T78_300234068529570_TS (which is on the same floe as the Polarstern)?

T78 reports every 30 minutes; there's reportedly an Obuoy reporting every 10
that would be better for accelerations (newtonian difference of velocity
column). The maximum observed change in T78 velocity is -0.135 km/hr over a 30
minute interval and +0.127 km/hr for speed-up relative to a mean velocity of
0.487 km/hr.

For your convenience, I have added six columns to the original spreadsheet
including an excel-ready haversine displacement formula based on the WGS84
earth radius. A column for wind speed at matching times needs to be added from
the linked table.

Got up to fifty kmph winds, with a rise of nearly a degree in temp in the last
hour. Twice the windspeed gfs is claiming at 1000hpa or surface.
Raining it is suposed to be with above zero surface to 850 Siberian coast to

Quite a spectacular photo today of two Mosaic scientists measuring upward heat
flux from 60m to the surface. The device isn't identified but is probably a
Rockland vertical microstructure profiler (VMP-250 turbulence profiler) of the
type used by I Fer in previously published field work, “On Thin Ice: Role of
Ocean Heat Flux in Sea Ice Melt”.

It has a buoyancy collar and weight release mechanism that allows it to be
operated in depth-to-surface mode. Various probes on the top measure shear, CTD
and other properties need to determine upward heat flux towards the cap of
relatively fresh water from melt pond run-off and bottom melt. Heat rising from
depth is very important to the onset and extent of the freezing season.

The Arctic Ocean has more than enough heat (from incoming Gulf Stream water) to
melt the entire icepack several times over. That water would not be
significantly present  at the current location of the PS at the depth
mentioned. However Atlantic Water has reached a depth of 80m inthe eastern
European Basin according to an important recent mooring study by Polyakov et
al.

Let’s mention that the statement above, originating from magazine-style
articles like
https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/08/
growing-underwater-heat-blob-speeds-demise-arctic-sea-ice
forgets to add that this has been the case for thousands of years.

The problem with facts like this thrown out of context here (the stratified
nature of the Arctic Ocean permits the ice pack to survive yearlong even when
warm Atlantic waters sink beneath) is that many posters keep repeating it as an
impending doom, but as I said, it has been the case probably since the last
deglaciation.

    tbuoy update for those interested in data

Very much so, thank you uniquorn.
I note that the negative air temps have managed to visibly reduce the temps
inside the ice, which should slow bottom melt rates significantly.

It's about time for the temperatures to drop and the melt to slow down. The sun
is close to the horizon at the pole. Temperatures have been in extra time for
too long. Yes, excellent graphic.

The paper cited by A-Team is important. The Laptev sea is undergoing
"Atlantification". Note that paper discusses conditions from about 3 years or
more back before this summer's surge of Atlantic water. I would expect the
Atlantification to get worse this fall and winter in response to the surge of
Atlantic water.

Location number 10 on the figure of tides and tidal currents shows very weak
tides and currents at the pole. That figure is relevant.

Also note that the GAC tapped into a small fraction of the heat in the Atlantic
layer which used to be found at depths below 150m, before Atlantification set
in. It takes a persistent very strong storm to mix up heat from that depth.
This summer's cyclone didn't cause the extent of mixing caused by the GAC. I
have not seen evidence that it mixed up water from the Atlantic water layer.

Agreed, but does the drift speed chart imply a tidal component of the same
order of magnitude as that caused by wind?

Uniquorn - I am new at trying to understand these buoy charts, but with the T81
chart does the significant shift of the temperature on the right side of the
peak in thermistors #35-50 and the shift of constant tail at 1.5 from #75 to #
60  suggest the bottom is melting?

I think we need someone who's been under ice to answer that definitively. It's
part of the melting process but it could be 'slushy ice' saturated with sea
water. Have a look at the heat30 and heat120 data. They sometimes provide a
clearer picture.

    FooW:that paper discusses conditions from about 3 yearsback before this
    summer's surge of Atlantic water. I would expect the Atlantification to get
    worse.

Right. It's not just Mosaic pushing scientific revelations about the current
melting season out to 2023, most 'current' journal articles are 2-3 years 
back. There's a terrible mismatch between the rapid rate of Arctic change, the
needs of policy planners, and mechanisms for keeping scientific research up to
date.

To take just two examples, the biggest news this melt season was shoaling of
Atlantic Waters and erosion of stratification described in the two Polyakov
papers. Those had 2020 submission dates, spent 8 months in peer review but
actually analyzed mooring data from 2004-2018 with the main focus 2016-18.

So what happened in 2019 and 2020? We have near real time satellite coverage
and weather reanalysis, so surface ice comings and goings, wind, sea surface
temperatures and sea surface salinities along with their statistical anomalies.

What's missing is what we're mostly interested in: worsening conditions below
the sea surface. Polyakov has given excellent interviews that clarify tipping
point consequences but their impact is diminished by lack of current
information. If it was an emergency back then, what is it now?

The main nrt update option seems to be the Mercator Ocean model. It's not at
all clear what modern mooring tie points if any have been assimilated there. MO
has salinities and temperatures at -30m and -100m but now farther back than
2019. Temperature anomalies are only available for the surface.

It's not correct to attribute the record position of the ice front on the
Atlantic side to melt or specifically to atlantification induced melt. A lot of
the 'melt' has just been displacement by the wind.

Quote

    The Arctic will freeze over every year long after the first BOE

Substitute 'Barents' for 'Arctic' above? The Barents, some 1500 km farther
north than the southern Chukchi, has been in near-total BOE year-round for
decades.The northern third has ice cover in winter but it apparently none of it
forms locally: it is all blown in from the Kara and Arctic Ocean.

The Barents Sea counterpart to the Polyakov papers is S Lind's 2018 review of
Barents oceanography which finds an equally dire ongoing atlantification there
but for data ending in 2016. It's been cited 131 times since but has not
brought up to date.

The story there is fresh water from ice melt is needed to sustain
stratification but it's not there any more in the necessary volume. The Barents
is approaching terminal atlantification.

Arctic warming hotspot in the northern Barents Sea linked to declining sea-ice
import

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0205-y
https://www.carbonbrief.org/
atlantification-arctic-sea-tipping-towards-new-climate-regime

The Arctic has warmed dramatically in recent decades, with greatest temperature
increases observed in the northern Barents Sea. The warming signatures are not
constrained to the atmosphere, but extend throughout the water column. Here,
using a compilation of hydrographic observations from 1970 to 2016, we
investigate the link between changing sea-ice import and this Arctic warming
hotspot.

A sharp increase in ocean temperature and salinity is apparent from the
mid-2000s, which we show can be linked to a recent decline in sea-ice import
and a corresponding loss in freshwater, leading to weakened ocean
stratification, enhanced vertical mixing and increased upward fluxes of heat
and salt that prevent sea-ice formation and increase ocean heat content. Thus,
the northern Barents Sea may soon complete the transition from a cold and
stratified Arctic to a warm and well-mixed Atlantic-dominated climate regime.

     The year dates on the salinity graphic seem to be reversed.  It looks like
reverse Atlantification from the first image (2019) to the second (2020).  For
example, north of FJF goes from mostly red in 2019 to mostly yellow in 2020.

Could a higher loss in ice volume result in lower salinity due to more fresh
water or is this irrelevant in such depths? (Please delete, if this question is

Reasonable and not Stupid.

In previous melt seasons possibly, but one challenge the Arctic faces is
increasing intrusion of more saline Atlantic and Pacific water, at steadily
decreasing depths.  This makes the additional melt less relevant.

What also makes it less relevant is the general decrease in the "lens" of
somewhat fresher water that used to persist year over year in the central
Arctic and to some degree the Beaufort.  If it contributed to that, additional
melt would help slow down the year over year decline in ice.  However under the
rapidly evolving conditions we've seen over the last 10-15 years, it is not as
helpful a factor as it might have been.  Far better would be for it to have
remained ice instead.

Good spotting! The dates are correct though. (It is easy to get them wrong in
processing.) So it doesn't quite fit our presuppositions. SimonF92 offers a
plausible explanation. It is instructive to see Mercator Ocean putting in
observation instead of just modeling away on a trend narrative.

The two slides below show the surface salinity relative to the current
AMSR2_AWI ice pack boundary, most of which is cut away in the first slide.
Somehow MO has values for not directly observable salinity -- areas that have
been under the ice pack for years and years, most notably the band between the
NP and SV-FJL.

If their data can be believed, atlantification is much farther along than what
one would guess from Atlantic Waters qua western boundary current + some tidal
turbulence around the Yermak Plateau (eg Whaler's Bay). If so, there are issues
to consider in slightly lower surface and bottom water freezing temperatures.
Quote

    For every 5 psu increase in salinity, the freezing point decreases by 0.28
    degrees C; thus, in polar regions with an ocean salinity of about 32 psu,
    the water begins to freeze at -1.8 degrees C -- NSIDC

The key Lind paper discussed in #1110 doesn't foresee total atlantification of
the Barents until 2040; however the residual front between Arctic Ocean and
North Atlantic waters is quite indistinct in the Mercator Ocean view of surface
salinity. While it is somewhat more apparent in the 30m and 100m views, it
seems a stretch to call this an effective halocline. With the ice pack edge so
far away this year, it's unclear whether ice blown in will provide the
necessary volume of fresh water melt to renew stratification.

What do you suppose the scientific objective is, releasing them so close
together? The buoys could lie on a regular grid across their base floe and so
sample a large area avoiding the potential bias from placing just one buoy at
an convenient location by the ship. These buoys are likely to stay together
over winter and well into next melt season since the floe will be getting
thicker and more stable.

We can do the kriging from the buoy data if they don't get to it but it will
need lots of dp or an accurate description from 'Follow' of grid dimensions and
buoy numbering (don't hold breath). The output gives continuous values (raster
image) interpolated from the initial number of input buoys.

The ship's mission: to assist the MOSAiC expedition's flagship vessel, the
German icebreaker Polarstern, in setting up a network of drifting research
stations on the Arctic sea ice.

Drifting on a ship in the middle of the Arctic Ocean, four women listened in
quiet disbelief to the rules of a new dress code.

No leggings. No crop tops. No "hot pants." Nothing too tight or too revealing.

In the following weeks, the new rules would breed an undercurrent of
resentment.

Expedition leaders denied the rules were meant to single out women. But many
MOSAiC participants felt they perpetuated an insidious form of sexism: the idea
that women's bodies are a distraction in the workplace and that women are
responsible for managing the behavior of men.

The dress code was just one of several factors that participants say
contributed to an unwelcoming atmosphere for the women on board Akademik
Fedorov.

Problems with harassment were happening before the dress code was announced,
raising concerns that the two events might be related. Later in the expedition,
participants pointed out inequalities in the division of work assignments
between men and women.

All the while, the mission was suffering from gender disparity. Women made up
less than a third of the MOSAiC participants on the ship, and only a handful of
the mission's senior scientists and engineers.

The breakdown was similar on Akademik Fedorov. The vessel exchanged personnel
with the Polarstern several times, but at any given point there were about 25
women on board, compared with about 60 men.

There's hope that the field is becoming more balanced over time. Women now
represent more than half the membership in the Association of Polar Early
Career Scientists, a global organization of students and early-career
academics.

But even as their numbers grow, women still face unique challenges in the
field.

On Akademik Fedorov, the dress code was the first issue to raise widespread
discussions about gender inequalities.

Before departing, participants were told they should dress warmly when
venturing outdoors. They should wear sturdy, closed-toe shoes on the decks and
don hard hats in certain work areas. And they must remove dirty boots and
jackets before entering the mess hall, for sanitary reasons.

Otherwise, for the first two weeks, participants dressed for comfort when they
weren't working outdoors. Athletic clothing, leggings, yoga pants and even
shorts were common attire inside the warm corridors of the ship.

That changed with the new dress code.

It's possible they are waiting for clear weather to distribute them but why not
take some closer data while it's foggy etc.
If they don't redeploy it might be possible to create a more static
presentation that shows very small lateral differences. Say, take the middle
buoy and subtract its latlon from all the buoys. That would make it possible to
maintain a very small focussed area at the loss of drift data. super zoomed
delaunay.

Hopefully all genders feel equal on this thread.

If you ran the Mercator animation at 100m depth for the whole year you would
see that the stormy winter with strong cyclonic conditions in the Arctic ocean
favored the influx of Atlantic water into the Barents sea and into the Laptev
sea along the continental shelf margin. The relatively fresh water on the moved
in the direction of the Fram strait. This is what happens when the polar vortex
is strong through the winter. Some fresh water stored in the Beaufort gyre is
released when the Beaufort high is replaced by frequent cyclones.

The Fram strait has salty Atlantic water flowing in on the European side and
fresh Arctic water flowing out on the Greenland side so the picture gets very
complicated near the Fram strait. It's three dimensional and a substantial
fraction of Atlantic water gets retroflected back down along the coast of
Greenland. Perhaps eddies involving retroflected Atlantic water  formed this
summer when high pressure caused consistent anticyclonic winds north of
Greenland. Perhaps not. It would be interesting to see sounding profiles at
locations from Greenland to the pole.

What ever, much has happened over the past 12 months and that Mercator
comparison gif shows a general cyclonic rotation of the salty and fresh water
masses, not the details of how it evolved.

And about that dress code. Men need to evolve. The situation on board sounds
very paternalistic and hostile to women scientists.

From the story by the EE News reporter it's hinted that harassment may have
come from the crew. This may not be a problem of male scientists misbehaving -
although they certainly are capable. It doesn't take much extrapolation to
conclude that there was a serious leadership problem. The proper response to
sexual harassment is not to tell the women how to dress after an episode of
harassment. That's blaming the women for bad behavior by the men.

 If the leaders of this mission wanted to have a dress code they needed to
suggest it before the mission began so it could be discussed and so women could
plan their wardrobes for the trip. Let's be clear - this was a failure of
leadership on top of bad behavior by individuals.

Back to the buoys. Those buoys needed to be deployed between Greenland and the
pole, not in some tight group near the pole. They may learn something about
dispersion or they may be awaiting an opportunity to deploy them on a larger
grid but they blew the chance to study the region that is behaving in the most
unusual way this year. I'm a geochemist, not an oceanographer, so I'm not an
expert on this, but I don't have confidence that Mercator is getting the
details right on what's happening between Greenland and the pole. Every model
needs data or it's just garbage in, garbage out. This year's low area, extent
and thickness north of Greenland was unprecedented, yet MOSAiC powered right
through it, apparently without studying what's going on. I guess that they had
already made their plans and they weren't going to disrupt them to do new
science.

By the way, the EE article implies that A-Team's observations about the PR lady
are on point.

I'm hoping that we will see some great research results from this mission in a
few years, but I can't help but feel that they missed unique research
opportunities. What is obvious is that the management did not empower women
scientists. They did a very poor job of planning on how to deal with harassment
before the mission began then dealt with it poorly when it happened.

drift update using T78.
Tbuoy temperature data. Not long to wait till core temp drops to allow us to
get a clearer idea of where the ice/ocean interface is. updated below
P234 drift speed update

Thinking overnight about the Pbuoy deployment, we know that there were many
more local buoys on the first floe. Perhaps they are sharing even more buoy
data this time. I haven't had time to calculate any distances yet, but a close
array of buoys might be useful for documenting reduction of motion during the
early stages of the freeze cycle in relation to other measurements being taken.

Agreed, possibly a missed opportunity with the north greenland gap. Maybe they
thought they had to get through it before it closed up.

    drift update using T78.
    Tbuoy temperature data. Not long to wait till core temp drops to allow us
    to get a clearer idea of where the ice/ocean interface is.
    P234 drift speed update

    Thinking overnight about the Pbuoy deployment, we know that there were many
    more local buoys on the first floe. Perhaps they are sharing even more buoy
    data this time. I haven't had time to calculate any distances yet, but a
    close array of buoys might be useful for documenting reduction of motion
    during the early stages of the freeze cycle in relation to other
    measurements being taken.

    Agreed, possibly a missed opportunity with the north greenland gap. Maybe
    they thought they had to get through it before it closed up.


I have been thinking about it too, I know that covid19 has disrupted some of
their operations. Is it possible that there was some sort of disruption to crew
operation that forced them to deploy the Pbuoys in such a way? Doesnt say much
on their twitter.

It's turned significantly colder on the 38m mast at the current PS location.
The only winds of consequence are westerlies off the AK coast that could still
affect remnant ice in the Beaufort.

88.7  110.1 20-09-09 15:00  8 m/s  -7.6ºC

The polar night does not officially set in for another two weeks but daylight
is winding down now. "Follow" is showing a snowy scene (depth not reported) but
as usual we have no idea what we are looking at or when. There's no news at sea
ice ticker and no announcement about the new buoy swarm at meereis.

It's too soon to say if significant science will emerge from all their efforts.
While the original vision could not be executed, some of the ad hoc
improvisation could have value.  However the inability to fly Polar 5&6 as
scheduled was a huge loss in terms of broadening their observational swath..

They could not get timely permission from Canada, US, Denmark or Norway to fly
ship-synchronized routes out of Alert, Thule, Nord or Longyearbyen as in past
years. Those facilities have to maintain zero tolerance for covid19
introduction given everyone is confined in small places indoors with minimal
medical support and difficult options for evacuation and site decontamination.

I wonder if Mosaic with be the last expedition of its type. While it's great to
have a ship out there, the cost-effectiveness of new satellites, air-dropped
buoys and undersea glider is increasing. A ship can carry large containers full
of massive high tech gear but deploying it away from the diesel pollution
envelope doesn't work out any more due to extreme ice mobility.

Societally, Nansen and Sverdrup were fully out of touch for three years;
Dranitsyn lived in a floe tent for a year on canned food. Nowadays it's hard to
find people willing to be offline for even a day despite sauna, pool, fresh
cooked meals, two bars and dancing; this got them into 6 legs, attendant
resupply complexity, and eventually third-round draft choices for technicians.

First attempt at delaunay triangulation on the close Pbuoys. This only uses the
hourly locations. lat/lon scale is in metres.
Lateral movement at this scale is too fast to view the small changes in
position so one buoy's lat/lon (in metres) has been subtracted from all buoys.
That buoy is at 0,0.

We should be able to tell when freeze sets in.
The 3d version might be interesting on this close set

Adding a fine grid adds another 5MB to the file size. Either there is quite a
lot of movement within this 1.44km^2 area or we are at the limits of gps
tracking this far north. I forgot that the presentation is not square, will
look into that (squashed it horizontally).
Data is from iabp The conversion from lat/lon to utm is from plot-svalbard,
saved as csv. Delaunay is run in octave. data is attached below as text.

Taking pixel measurements on the above 11-buoy grid (final frame) and
converting them to meters (at 3.26 m/pxl), the grid dimensions came out as
shown below. (The x axis should have been rescaled to make it match the y.)

The animation above shows them to be stable in the short term, suggesting they
are all embedded in the same floe (likely the same one as the Polarstern). They
are not laid out in accordance to any strict geometrical pattern, probably
because melt ponds and other irregularities precluded that.

The area came out to 282327 m^2 or about a fifth of a sq km. The situation
mimics exactly what Krige had for boreholes in South African gold mining
country so his method can be applied directly to whatever the buoys are
measuring, ie the yellow below will get more nuanced coloring.

Cold at the Polarstern, balmy in the Beaufort, Chukchi, ESS, Laptev, Kara and
Barents.

The two adventurers had internet/sat phone the whole time and expert tech team
support for it. Enough to send those pictures, receive weather forecasts and
ice maps, have GPS lat lon and communicate with the rescue team on the rented
icebreaker about the hopeless ice on the Svalbard side.

The Polarstern also has excellent internet according to the company that
provided it with a new type of satellite. However they did not allow scientific
staff to use it, only whatsapp on an outside stairwell and iridium if they
bought a time card at the ship store.

There were apparently three reasons for this policy: AWI HQ wanted total
control of PR messaging, a need for streaming home large data files, and
enforcement of team interaction (rather than have everyone hunched over their
laptop once back on ship).

Some participants brought their phones and recorded blogs, videos and stills
for release on twitter once back home. Only 3-4 people have done that though,
Lars K, M Shupe, S Hendricks and C Katlein being the best.

Suggests to me the ice is in worse shape even than what the expedition team
leadership has already shown us.

It will be interesting to see what some of those researchers say and publish
when they return.

Mosaic posted a beautiful photo of the new mooring site taken by a small drone
on Sunday 06 Sept 2020. Since the Polarstern is 180m in length bow to stern, a
grid of those specs can be put over the image to establish a distance scale of
2 pixels per meter.

However the drone was not directly overhead at the time of the photo because
the more of the port than starboard side is shown (assuming the smokestack is
centered amidship). As usual, all the Exif data has been stripped off the
photo: we do not know time of day (sun angle), direction of north, nor height
of the drone, nor nadir inclination of the camera.

The location of the Polarstern varied quite a bit that day, ranging from
88.7-8º  113.5-119.0º, so the lat lon at the time of the photo can only be
estimated.

Consequently it is not possibly to orthorectify the photo for purposes of
measure percent of melt pond area, leads and so forth. They've used Sentinel-2
in past months but that requires fog- and cloud-free conditions and decent
sunlight at the time of overpass.

The new road system is visible but just barely. It heads out to 3-4 unlabelled
gear depots where oceanographic and meteorological measurements are made. Some
sites can be related to earlier ground-level scenes of sampling.

A curious feature of the photo: a swath 600 x 100 m just 'north' of the ship
appears to show recent snow covering recently frozen melt ponds. The latter are
visible after contrast enhancement. After that correction, the melt pond size
and distribution appear fairly homogenous. They are in all stages of drainage
and connectivity, well indicated by shades of blue. Black leads of open water
and shattered ice cannot be interpreted without knowing how the ship approached
the mooring site.

Mosaic's science communication through the ages:
Quote

    Goethe 1774: Misunderstandings and lethargy perhaps produce more wrong in
    the world than deceit and malice do. At least the latter two are certainly
    rarer.

    Heinlein 1941 "You have attributed conditions to villainy that simply
    result from stupidity."

But these MOSAiC people in charge aren't stupid. They are control freaks right
down to their misogynistic dress code. They did have bad luck concerning the
virus, and they deserve to be cut some slack about that, but cutting off normal
internet communications while the pandemic was ongoing was a brutal and
insensitive thing to do to people concerned about aging parents and children at
home.

IIRC correctly they posted some image showing people covering melt ponds (or
was it a text saying the same?) That ponds are only covered near the ship tells
me this is artificial.
In any case I would have thought at this very northern latitude and very late
date that ponds should have been top-frozen by now, so these widespread blue
ponds are IMHO another attestation to the strength of this melting season.

I think we may be too harsh on mosaic. We have had loads of buoy data but it
seems few are interested in it (or are willing to share their analysis). 1.4%
of viewers can be bothered to look at recent ice temperature data to estimate
thickness when it is practically spoon fed to them.

    look at ice thickness when spoon fed to them.

Yes but 99.8% won't provide feedback on an improved ice concentration product
even when it is solicited. They would rather copy/paste obsolete extent data
Provided by Authorities on an untended pipeline whose errors go unnoticed for
years.

My sense is that buoy data needs a lot more edu: arrows drawn on stills, longer
prose accounts of basics, fewer assumptions that such and such is obvious,
tutorials even, sharing of explanations provided by buoy owners. Buoys have a
history of bizarre malfunctions; people not specializing in them lack
confidence in interpretation. No one ever errs on a forum by providing too much
explanation:

https://quoteinvestigator.com/2020/03/01/underestimate/ HL Mencken 1926

The buoys reporting over iridium, international blowback if they had
sequestered or encrypted that data. Buoys just reporting over LAN, we don't
know how many are not shared at the meereis gallery.

That bow radar was good sharing while it lasted. I don't have a problem with it
being done so stupidly but rather with their refusal to fix it.

In terms of dumbing down lat lon to 1 dp, now that took active malice. but it
was also stupid because the ship was visible to 4dp on daily high resolution
satellite imagery.

After Oct 2019, they never systematically disclosed what sensors were working
at what locations at what times, presumably to avoid embarrassment.

A lot of what they did was driven by institutional prestige considerations that
trumped any thought of sharing, especially after that truth-telling BBC
reporter.

The Polarstern had a 30 year history of publishing a weekly captan's blog. Like
everything else not under direct control of PR officers, it had to go. Mosaic
was too big; the tail began to wag the dog.

Negotiations before the trip: they got everyone to agree on a central data
repository but the price for that was keeping it shut down until 2023 when all
interest would be gone. The culture of leisurely publication is deeply
entrenched; it's a good fit with scientific escapism and controversy avoidance.

In fairness, a lot of coupled observational time series like the one below do
not lend themselves to sharing. The data needs calibration and review first.
However there is a middle road not taken -- a full year in to the expedition,
this is really the first we have heard about these fancy drones and their
mission.

AWI is research foundation of about a thousand staff founded in 1980; it is not
a university or educational facility but rather part of the broader Helmholtz
Association. The present expedition fits into their organizational chart as
shown below.

Im working on the stuff from last season but the data is pretty poor to be
honest. There are 4 'active' thermistor buoys, but only T78 is providing
reliable data at this point. The thickness for that one seems to be 90cm-1m.

The drone photo is both beautiful and shocking because of the blue water in the
ponds apparently on 6 September. Because the basic info identifying the photo
has been stripped, I'm left wondering if it was actually taken in the month of
September at the pole.

With regard to the new ice concentration product, it takes time to become
familiar with new tools, graphics and data sets. I'm not ready yet to comment
on it and I'm pretty sure that how it is for other people here.

I have actually been restraining my anger at the Mosiac management.  We live in
a period where politicians and "authorities" are gaslighting us. Science is
under attack, especially in the U.S., right down to forecasts by the National
Hurricane Center and reports by the CDC. Scientists need to respond by
interacting with the public in a forthright and honest way - with data and
figures that have appropriate identification, quality control and quality
assurance. I'm not talking about crazy levels of QA/QC like I dealt with in the
nuclear waste research business, but reasonable stuff like keeping the basic
identifiers on photos.

I'm retired now but I once managed research projects and grants for the feds.
If some group did the bullshit that Mosaic management has done, I would be
inclined to never give them another dime if it was may say. What they are doing
is undermining the public confidence in science. I don't expect them to share
all of their data. Much information may need critical review before it is
released to the public. I get that. But don't feed me bullshit and deception
like we have given from the leaders of Mosaic.

Yes, the research drones are fantastic. I got excited about drones for research
when they were used studying volcanic eruptions in Iceland and Hawaii. Great
stuff. Great potential.

I couldn't find any specs on either drone (such as flight range, flight
duration, maximal altitude and kg of payload). The big one has an utterly
unsearchable name (Spectra) but appears to be made in India; I can only direct
you to their marketing team for further information. However there are no
prospects for autonomous flights over any sizable part of the Arctic.

The two working aircraft AWI is currently operating could do a whole lot more
more. They don't need the Polarstern down below, being capable of stop-and-go
landings for spot ice measurements as was done out of Alert (but not exactly
disclosed).

This is very different situation from Greenland where the radar instrument
builder required prompt and full public disclosure online of every track. Or
NASA satellites -- imagine the uproar if they delayed fire weather release
until every possible 2023 publications had been bagged.

Polar 5 is a DC-3 built in 1942 but refurbished as a Basler BT-67 after the AWI
acquired the plane in 2007. Without payload, the flying range is around 3900
km, enough for instrumented  transects. Polar 6, another DC-3, was acquired by
AWI in 2011. It is doing the thickness transects but not sharing anything about
them.

In January 2005, Polar 4 was severely damaged during a rough landing at the
British over-wintering station Rothera on the Antarctic Peninsula. It was
impossible to repair the plane and now parts are in a museum. Since then,
scientific and logistical tasks of polar flights have been performed by Polar
2. In February 1985, the Polar 3 was shot down by guerrillas of the Polisario
Front over West Sahara. All three crew members died. It was on its way back
from Antarctica and had taken off in Dakar, Senegal, to reach the  Canary
Islands.

        We need to up our own game and get some planks out of our eyes.


    Im working on the stuff from last season but the data is pretty poor to be
    honest. There are 4 'active' thermistor buoys, but only T78 is providing
    reliable data at this point. The thickness for that one seems to be
    90cm-1m.

Had a look at T81 and the data is challenging. The colder weather is helping at
the surface but not really at the ice/ocean interface yet. Dropped to -1.69C on
sep10.

    The drone photo is both beautiful and shocking because of the blue water in
    the ponds apparently on 6 September. Because the basic info identifying the
    photo has been stripped, I'm left wondering if it was actually taken in the
    month of September at the pole.

Air temperature was mostly below 0C at PS location for a week before sep6. The
pond water would have to be quite [DEL:fresh:DEL] saline.

aug25 was first full day on the floe according to fomo. Pics of fog. A lot of
days with fog in awimet weather report

The camps and tracks look quite well developed.

    My sense is that buoy data needs a lot more edu: arrows drawn on stills,
    longer prose accounts of basics, fewer assumptions that such and such is
    obvious, tutorials even

You're probably right. Arrows on things no one looks at. Post some buoy data
once a month.

Re this thread's stats, bear in mind many people read and are interested but do
not have much to contribute and do not wish to clutter the thread.

Oren points out that people may read but not post, and may look at the
thumbnails of the graphics but not open them up and thus not get counted as
having viewed the graphic. I can confirm anecdotally that Oren is correct. I am

I don't think meltwater ponds can be saline due to brine rejection, so either
it must be fresh water or actually saline ocean water?

A 'true' doughnut-shaped 'melt pond' would be 'pure' sea water.  A shallow melt
pond on a thick cold (at its core) floe will be mostly fresh (but maybe too
saline for drinking).  In between these extremes there will be degrees of
salinity., depending on how much mixing occurred.  Even honeycomb ice (which I
know about from lake ice) will inhibit mixing some.

    salinity/freshness of melt ponds varies

Right. It is not an either/or situation. Measured PSU (practical salinity
units) can vary from near zero to 35 from pond to pond (ie fresh to brackish to
salty) depending on drainage and connectivity to other ponds and open leads,
possibly stratified by depth if dense brine channels become exposed. Brine is
partially extruded upward onto newly formed ice -- it does not all sink out the
bottom. Arctic FYI is generally too salty to supply drinkable melt water to
humans. The city limit is 1000 ppm or about 1/35 of sea water.

https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/water-salinity-d_1251.html

Since only 10's of cm of very low snow-water-equivalent snow fell this year
along the Polarstern's route and that rapidly redeposited in the lee of
pressure ridges, it's clear that an observed landscape of meter-deep melt pond
was not filled with snow melt but rather with in situ ice melt.

A whole lot more is written about summer melt ponds than about what happens to
them over the winter and spring. In a scene like the north pole, half the
August landscape was melt ponds -- and not superficial ones at that. It follows
the SYI will be very pocketed with them in the spring. None of this shows up in
'volume' models.

Yes it all freezes but depending on how fresh, brackish or saline it was, it
never really "becomes one" with the ambient ice that matured but never melted.
The ice retains aspects of its history; it never becomes one big crystal. Melt
ponds have been around since forever but the issue today is the extent of ice
heterogeneity -- it's gotten much greater. None of this shows up in satellite
altimetry. It's often assumed for convenience that the ice pack is in local
buoyancy equilibrium but it isn't really.

Since the freezing/melting point changes with salinity from 0ºC to -1.8ºC,
floes wilt melt unevenly given their embedded melt ponds and false bottoms. If
a melt pond began as brackish or salty, it will develop its own brine; if it
never established a drain, that brine may become trapped. Brine reaches its
eutectic point at −21.2 °C at which point it is 23.3% salt by mass.

https://www.britannica.com/science/seawater/Density-of-seawater-and-pressure
https://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/solutions/faq/
saltwater-ice-volume.shtml

And don't be fooled by oceanography jargon. They'll talk about a giant pool of
'fresh water' in the Beaufort Gyre when in point of fact, there isn't any at
all. The somewhat lower salinity equates to a certain volume of hypothetical
pure fresh water needed to be added to the Beaufort Sea to lower the psu. But
observed could equally well have been attained with brackish.

"Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) production in the northern Arctic Ocean has been
considered to be minimal because of high sea ice concentration and extremely
low productivity. However, we found DMS concentration (1–33 nM) in melt ponds
on sea ice at a very high latitude (78°N) in the central Arctic Ocean to be up
to ten times that in the adjacent open ocean (<3 nM). We divided melt ponds
into three categories: freshwater melt ponds, brackish melt ponds, and open
saline melt ponds. Melt ponds from each category had different formation
mechanisms and associated DMS contents. Closed brackish ponds (salinity of >20)
had particularly high DMS concentration. Water in brackish ponds was mixed with
open ocean water in the past via a hole at the bottom of the floe that kept the
pond open to the ocean; therefore, unlike freshwater melt ponds, brackish ponds
became sites of DMS accumulation.

https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/em/c9em00195f#!divAbstract
high DMS

In sea ice, interconnected pockets and channels of brine are surrounded by
fresh ice. Over time, brine is lost by gravity drainage and flushing. The
timing of salt release and its interaction with the underlying water can impact
subsequent sea ice melt. Turbulence measurements 1 m below melting sea ice
north of Svalbard reveal anticorrelated heat and salt fluxes. From the
observations, 131 salty plumes descending from the warm sea ice are identified,
confirming previous observations from a Svalbard fjord. The plumes are likely
triggered by oceanic heat through bottom melt. Calculated over a composite
plume, oceanic heat and salt fluxes during the plumes account for 6 and 9 % of
the total fluxes, respectively, while only lasting in total 0.5 % of the time.
The observed salt flux accumulates to 7.6 kg m−2, indicating nearly full
desalination of the ice. Bulk salinity reduction between two nearby ice cores
agrees with accumulated salt fluxes to within a factor of 2. The increasing
fraction of younger, more saline ice in the Arctic suggests an increase in
desalination processes with the transition to the “new Arctic”.

https://os.copernicus.org/articles/14/127/2018/os-14-127-2018.html brine plumes
by Svalbard

In the summer months, melt water from the surface of the Arctic sea ice can
percolate down through the ice and flow out of its base. This water is
relatively warm and fresh compared to the ocean water beneath it, and so it
floats between the ice and the oceanic mixed layer, forming pools of melt water
called under-ice melt ponds. Sheets of ice, known as false bottoms, can
subsequently form via double diffusion processes at the under-ice melt pond
interface with the ocean, trapping the pond against the ice and completely
isolating it from the ocean below. This has an insulating effect on the parent
sea ice above the trapped pond, altering its rate of basal ablation.

The bow radar has resumed! It seems that acquisition never stopped but perhaps
transmission of files to shore has only now been possible.

This goes out 5km in all directions except towards off-ship experimental sites
so is a bit hard to register with the recent drone overhead of Sept 6th which
showed almost entirely experimental sites! They do not even have a phone cam
strapped to the radar mast to time-lapse for a visible correlation. (This does
not even require an app, they come capable.)

The first image below registers the drone with bow radar. FOMO does not share
compass direction on the drone shot nor its time of day (often given
ambiguously as 'ship time' rather than the UTC of the bow radar). The drone
photo only goes out 3.3 multiples of ship length (~400m) and so has far greater
resolution than the bow radar which goes out 5000 m but with only ~500 pixels
for it.

At any rate, some incredible ice advection can be seen in the 6-hour frame rate
of the mp4 below, as well as the usual opening/closing of leads. As the ice
freezes, the bow radar shows more brittle fracture than the mushy scenes of
quasi-independent floes from the Fram.

FOMO has not made clear whether power lines and fiber optic data lines are
being run out to remote sensors (which are only 4-5 ship lengths away this
time). Consequently it is hard to determine whether trails and lines have been
disrupted by lead openings and floe shifts.

Fascinating though local ice motion may be visually, it is not at all clear how
to describe it scientifically or compare year on year (ie is it fracturing
more). After N-ICE2015, its (very different) bow radar was written up in highly
obscure technical terms. The real goal is to correlate it with wind stress and
mechanical strength of the ice so the latter tensor can be deduced over the
whole pack (without a ship being there) since the wind and drag are known
fairly well from reanalysis.

Yes the colder air at surface has been replaced and the upper air is warm too
over Polarstern. But not diamond dust. That's usually seen in almost near clear
air with temperatures below -12 C. As the milder air moved in Polarstern was
reporting snow grains at first but as temperatures rose near zero the grains
were replaced with freezing rain.

Models are forecasting it to turn cooler again by Wednesday. But no doubt there
will be many mild incursions too this autumn.

In terms of correcting the full-time DWD meteorologist on board the Polarstern
who entered that call on the hourly awiMet report going to ECMWF, not going to
do that from where I sit in smokey Arizona.

The FOMO today seems to show an icebow flanking an air temperature inversion
giving rise to a pronounced refracted solar mirage of a type commonly seen in
the Arctic. The optics are discussed in the attached pdf.

Wayne, a member here who has lived many years in far north Nunavut, has written
very extensively about these inversions and what they mean for conditions of
the ice but on Neven's blog, not the forums.

But as you say, it's all going to change.

No. Not correcting the meteorologist on board PS but our esteemed forum member
who mentioned diamond dust.The ww code reported by PS was 77, which is snow
grains. (Diamond dust is code 76). Next reports then were freezing rain.

Somewhere up-forum, all the weather commentaries for the entire expedition was
extracted into a flatfile database and a MS Word-type glossary system proposed
to stub in the code lookups to eliminate tedious and error-prone code lookups.
No one picked up that baton.

Meanwhile, the last three bow radar frames for the 13th show a very large lead
opening immediately in front of the Polarstern's bow if not right under the
ship. We have no better time resolution for the cycle of closed, open, closed
than 12 hours but it may have been much shorter. The lead is 68m wide on
average; 6 km of length is visible to the outer edge of the image. It is a
rocker event, so more a pivot than a shear.

This may or may not have done any damage to gangways, ice anchors, cables and
experimental set-ups. It's possible field work was ongoing despite the
miserable weather and staff separated by open water from the ship. Radar
coverage of the experimental area has been blocked out the entire trip whereas
N-ICE2015 had full 360º coverage.

All we know for certain at this time is that 'Follow Mosaic' will downplay --
or not even mention -- the incident no matter how much damage it caused. Indeed
the 13th on FOMO is all smiles on a nitrate survey on yet another idyllic day.

The ship is in a surprisingly active area of ice motion due to a small cyclone
enveloping it so this event will not be the end of it.

As the light goes away and the inversions over the ice intensify the ice edge
becomes like a stationary front between air masses because the water still has
heat. The pole is shockingly close to the ice edge this September so storms
will be intensified by the boundary and can be expected to cause the Mosaic
team many challenges.

The large scale synoptic pattern has chains of storms tracking from the north
Atlantic into the subpolar seas and into the Arctic ocean proper. The record
high heat content of the north Atlantic and possibly the Atlantic side of the
Arctic ocean is contributing to the storminess. We won't hear about the impacts
of these storms from the PR person, but expect more of them. The effects of the
loss of sea ice on the Atlantic side of the Arctic ocean are affecting CFS
model forecasts of the location of the polar vortex this fall, causing it to
move towards the north Atlantic in the model. If this verifies, storminess will
be intensified in the Barents and Kara seas as winter sets in.

I would guess that graupel was falling before it turned to freezing rain.
Graupel is icy snow, a tiny ice ball with a core of snow.

63 downloads, quite popular. Though no further analysis from them.
Looking at some thread stats is valid as we near the end of the mosaic project.
Gauging popularity of areas of analysis can be useful to determine viewer
interest and whether sizing an animation to fit the forum's tight limits is
worth the effort

Thanks, I hadn't  heard of diamond dust or graupel before.

    FooW: consider the big picture

This is helpful. We are taken up documenting day to day noise but it is all
happening for underlying climate change reasons.

The composite below looks at the position of the Polarstern relative to the
North Pole, the AMSR2 pole hole of no data, the wind power density, the
distance to the ice edge, and a cyclonic storm barreling up from the North
Atlantic that has brought measurable precipitation (2nd image, 3hr
accumulation).

The ship has been drifting rapidly and may reach the pole yet though the ice we
wanted them to look at will have drifted away. They are currently 454 km away
from the ice edge based on the pixel ratio for the pole to Morris Jesup. Note a

The worst ice movement of the whole year-long expedition is happening. It is
probably not a risk to the ship itself (though the rudder got rammed by a floe
earlier) but puts experimental equipment out on the ice in jeopardy.

'Follow Mosaic' has not said if they can keep field work going safely under
these conditions; in the past, great effort went into just keeping power lines
out and sensors upright and running. Today's post is all about chlorophyll,
fading light and zooplankton. The photo could be a week old for all we know.

It's hard to see the scientific value of sampling a hole or two over winter in
an immense ocean; how long will biological data stay relevant in the
fast-changing Arctic. Does AWI believe the coming BOE will bring a fisheries
and fossil fuel bonanza?

That 25km^2 of bow radar might overlay nicely onto buoy drift now that it is
relatively static. A shame it's not hourly.

The frenetic motion of floes continued for another day on Sept 15th. The
bouncing floe within the open lead is 170x170m; the scale is 10m per pixel.
Impacts on Mosaic operations remain undisclosed.

The Polarstern is represented by the gray ball; it is moored with its starboard
bow against the ice (not shown as blocked from radar), so the bow is pointing
east in the time series and ice motion below the ship is black (not
visualized). The frames are 0.1 sec apart vs 6 hours apart on board so the
motion is sped up 6*60*60*10 = 216,000 times, a lot but less than commonly done
for Jakobshavn or Petermann glaciers.

The last frame is midnight on Sept 15th. The floe is at 89.1º latitude with air
temperatures -4º, low enough to put a much-fractured ice skim on opening/
closing leads. They do have kayaks on board but helicopter, fog permitting, is
the main way to reach stranded equipment if indeed their specific floe is
affected.

The winds at the ship have died down considerably from their peak of 16m/s but
wind stress nearby can still propagate ice motion to their site.

The avi's frame of reference, while basically co-moving (lagrangian), has never
been explained. The radar antenna rotates in a full circle, taking less than a
minute to capture its scene. Of the 360 scenes taken per six hours, only one is
retained for the shared video. The rest are shown on the bridge and also on
meeting room monitors.

The bridge also has an instrument that measures ship heading, the angle between
the mid-ship half-axial line and a line to north pole. (The magnetic pole
cannot be used in the high Arctic.) This heading is shared to the radar display
along with other parameters that have all been cropped out, with truncated 2dp
lat lon and timestamp restored.

In production, each frame is rotated as specified by ship heading so north is
always straight up the white scale bar. The ship is rigidly attached on its
starboard side its floe by six sea anchors except when it breaks loose; anchors
are checked and re-sunk daily as necessary.

The floe commonly rotates during the six hour gap between frames. This causes
the 83º black-out area to rotate after correction to the fixed north pole
heading. Recent months have seen a red ball added to each image to indicate the
ship, rather than a more logical icon that shows bow and stern.

The center of the radar image (which verifies as a true circle) lies near the
bottom of this red ball, NOT on its center. This is the location of the bridge
mast on which the rotating radar is mounted several dozen meters above the
water.

We do not know if the black-out area is symmetric with respect to the ship's
long axis (perhaps because of intervening metal masts or smokestack); it may
not extend to the experimental area to avoid rfi. If so, ice immediately port
side is shown. The comparable radar on N-ICE2015 showed 360º.

The clumsy north icon obscuring the data is a recent add-on that serves no
known purpose. It walks east and west without holding its lat lon, its position
seemingly in accordance with blackout zone rotation.

Because the ship is so close to the pole, latitude lines converge rapidly. Only
the white bar center goes straight up. Other latitude lines are straight but
angled appropriately. The longitude lines are convex up and likely the expected
arcs of circles.

The floe is mostly drifting along with the regional ice pack (which is known
compact, ie at 100% sea ice concentration at 3x3 km resolution) but sometimes
cohesive motion breaks down and floes in the scene have quasi-independent
motions compatible with each other's constraints.

Motion of the Polarstern can be marked up within the video by tracking a lat
lon intersection between frames. This gives jointed line segments and segmental
mean velocities at six hour intervals. However GPS on ship and adjacent buoys
are half-hourly or less with 4 dp precision, meaning a spreadsheet with a
haversine column shows ship rotations and translations much better. as seen in
uniq's many buoy products.

The speeds are rather high relative to those seen during the past year, over
1.2 km/hr for extended stretches. The Polarstern was subjected to a CCW gale
force wind (small cyclone) during the affected period, likely responsible for
the stress leading to the dramatic ice break-up motions.

The red bars on the buoy speed graphs show that six-hour sampling is not close
enough to capture ups and downs in floe speeds whereas the half-hour buoy
iridium call are satisfactory.

The buoy data is at the meereis gallery; the excel-ready haversine formula
needs lat lon data in the first two columns; the csv speed file is attached.

Floe motion is as crazy as ever around the Polarstern's position of 89.1  107.4
despite mild winds of 4m/s and cold temperatures of -9.4ºC. Despite two weeks
of increasing ice chaos documented on bow radar, there has been no mention to
date of its effects on scientific equipment deployment on Follow  :) :) :)
Mosaic.

Instead, various science for science sake studies on snow flakes and algae are
described that seem like escapism. Thee could just as well have been done in
the Baltic. It might have been better to have just concentrated on studies
relevant to climate change. There's been almost no mention of that over the
last year.

The six hour time series raises questions about whether distinct floes exist at
this near-pole site. What's seen are blocks of ice joining up with other blocks
of ice, then leaving for another. When that repeats, the block boundaries are
often different with new fractures and leads as boundaries. Spatial constraints
limit the options though so despite many breaks and rejoins the picture can
eventual return to resemble to the start.

The notion of solid SYI ice blocks welded together into a matrix with weak
intervening FYI freezes doesn't seem applicable. Without having the whole
history of formation, how are floe boundaries defined if most are ever-changing
composites?

Watch out Mosaic!

There's been 14 second swells of 0.2 m coming out on the ESAS, AFTER passing
all the way from Fram, under them <reader beware, this is nonsense>. May be
having the effect you point out on the floe motion ATeam.
Also outburst flushing from Greenland, which looks to be going through
exponential runaway geothermal blowout <reader beware, nonsense>, has been
launching submarine landslides that are shedding violent fresh upwellings, and
possibly mini tsunami surges, which could look like standard tidal effects,
since the subglacial outbursts occur primarily at high tides. <nonsense>
Their "pretty frost flowers" are sadly a symptom of large energy injection from
water vapour condensing. Driving bottom melt.
Gotta click the stupid gif to see the 11m long period waves heading for them in
a few days.

The Mosaic expedition seems to be winding down/falling apart despite being
scheduled to continue until Oct 12th. That's not unusual, the horse begins to
gallop when it smells the barn.

It hasn't been made clear whether the 12th is the date when field equipment is
borught in and the engines fired up or the date of arrival at the dock in
Tromsø. The ice has been thickening but not to point where the return passage
of a week would be hindered.

The ship's position is currently 89.1  110.7, quite close to the pole but some
2274km from port at 69.6 18.9 which would require about 100 hours of travel
time in calm seas.

Ice movement yesterday continued to be extreme, or rather no one seemed to have
suspected prior to the expedition what the new normal would be. The long lead
re-opened again; it extends off the edge of the radar so 5km or more. The pack
also has a bulk rotational component and that 179m broken-off floe pounding on
the port side of the ship. This is surprising since the winds at their position
have been brisk but not exceptional, below 10m/s.

So "exponential runaway geothermal blowout" makes sense to you? OTG entire line
of reasoning is from never-never land and does not apply to planet Earth. EDIT:
In fact it's so totally off the grid that I suspect OTG is a nom-de-plume of

Absolutely (grrmble grrmble) and the gif is fantastic, almost like a Micky
Mouse picture. But as usual I miss scale from your gifs, and it is tedious to
have to freeze two frames, read the coordinates and then calculate the distance
to see that your gif is appr. 10 x 5 km square.

EDIT: The speed of drift swings between 10% and 20% of normal walking speed.
And the tidal swings are only a few hundred meters each way. The circular
movement I guess has more to do with changing wind direction than anything
else.

Great. As you guessed that one hopefully you will run the numbers to prove it.
Hourly wind direction from PS is here   P169 is near if you need buoy data.
I suspect it is the combination of both since wind drift appears to be of the
same order of magnitude as 'tidal drift' and it's a more likely explanation
than continuous tight wind vortexes at multiples of walking speed. 

Here attempting to overlay the tight group of buoys onto bow radar. Maybe they
are either side of a fault line or along a ridge. click for animation.

FOMO today: the last of the off-ship experimental equipment is being brought on
board for a Sept 20th departure. The original plan called for Oct 15th but that
was later changed to Oct 12th. They first set up on Oct 4th of 2019. They
arrived at the North Pole on Aug 20th 2020and to their present floe shortly
thereafter, so a month moored and a bare minimum of the freezing season
sampled.

It may take them a while to reach the ice edge from where they are with
helicopter fog, ice pressure and thickness hindering progress but open leads
and intermediate concentration favoring it. The Polarstern can do some work
while underway, notably surface water chemistry, disposable CTD casts and ice
thickness measurements.

It's possible the ship will pause underway or near the ice edge to study the
ice for a while. The return port is Bremerhaven as there are no more trip legs
and no reason to meet up in Norway.

A truly massive logistical effort under trying conditions that they
accomplished safely. It's too soon to say what scientific advances will come
out of all the data collected (which launched buoys will continue for years).
It seems like the primary focus was atmospheric boundary layer processes though
of course they looked at everything imaginable.

As a guess: incremental improvement in many areas of our understanding of the
Arctic but no real game-changers in terms of radical improvements to satellite
interpretation or seasonal ice prediction from improved models.

I went through the last 45 days of preprints at The Cryosphere journal looking
for new Mosaic articles. There was a third one there, another N-ICE2015 piece
now five years out, and quite a few others of interest to this and other Arctic
forums, select ones below.

Most of the articles have quite readable sections, better than the abstracts.
It's seldom a good idea to get too far from the mainstream in forum posts so
these provide a good baseline for those wanting anchors to reality.

Never forget that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The
burden of proof is always on the proposer; there is no burden of disproof on
the non-believer.

Estimating statistical errors in retrievals of ice velocity and deformation
parameters from satellite images and buoy arrays
https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/14/2999/2020/

Sea ice drifts under the influence of wind and ocean currents. Spatial
gradients in the sea ice motion lead to distortion of the sea ice cover, termed
deformation. The retrieval of sea ice drift vectors and deformation parameters
from pairs or sequences of satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has
gained increased attention during recent years because of the growing
availability of suitable data.. Sea ice kinematics is also studied based on
data from arrays of buoys or GPS receivers   which in addition can serve as
reference in comparisons to motion vectors obtained from SAR images. The
knowledge of spatially detailed motion and deformation fields is potentially
useful in ice navigation to locate divergent or compressive ice areas, as
complementary information for operational sea ice mapping, for validation of
models for forecasting of ice conditions, and for assimilation into ice models.

Seasonal transition dates can reveal biases in Arctic sea ice simulations
https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/14/2977/2020/

Arctic sea ice experiences a dramatic annual cycle, and seasonal ice loss and
growth can be characterized by various metrics: melt onset, breakup, opening,
freeze onset, freeze-up, and closing. By evaluating a range of seasonal sea ice
metrics, CMIP6 sea ice simulations can be evaluated in more detail than by
using traditional metrics alone, such as sea ice area. We show that models
capture the observed asymmetry in seasonal sea ice transitions, with spring ice
loss taking about 1–2 months longer than fall ice growth. The largest impacts
of internal variability are seen in the inflow regions for melt and freeze
onset dates, but all metrics show pan-Arctic model spreads exceeding the
internal variability range, indicating the contribution of model differences.
Through climate model evaluation in the context of both observations and
internal variability, we show that biases in seasonal transition dates can
compensate for other unrealistic aspects of simulated sea ice. In some models,
this leads to September sea ice areas in agreement with observations for the
wrong reasons.

New insights into radiative transfer in sea ice derived from autonomous ice
internal measurements
https://tc.copernicus.org/preprints/tc-2020-184/

The radiative transfer of short-wave solar radiation through the sea ice cover
of the polar oceans is a crucial aspect of energy partitioning at the
atmosphere-ice-ocean interface. A detailed understanding of how sunlight is
reflected and transmitted by the sea ice cover is needed for an accurate
representation of critical processes in climate and ecosystem models, such as
the ice-albedo feedback. Due to the challenges associated with ice internal
measurements, most information about radiative transfer in sea ice has been
gained by optical measurements above and below the sea ice. To improve our
understanding of radiative transfer processes within the ice itself, we
developed a new kind of instrument equipped with a number of multispectral
light sensors that can be frozen into the ice. A first prototype consisting of
a 2.3 m long chain of 48 sideward planar irradiance sensors with a vertical
spacing of 0.05 m was deployed at the geographic North Pole in late August
2018, providing autonomous, vertically resolved light measurements within the
ice cover during the autumn season. Here we present the first results of this
instrument, discuss the advantages and application of the prototype and provide
first new insights into the spatiotemporal aspect of radiative transfer within
the sea ice itself. In particular, we investigate how measured attenuation
coefficients relate to the optical properties of the ice pack, and show that
sideward planar irradiance measurements are equivalent to measurements of total
scalar irradiance.

Implications of surface flooding on airborne thickness measurements of snow on
sea ice
https://tc.copernicus.org/preprints/tc-2020-168/

Snow thickness observations from airborne snow radars, such as the NASA’s
Operation IceBridge (OIB) mission, have recently been used in altimeter-derived
sea ice thickness estimates, as well as for model parameterization. A number of
validation studies comparing airborne and in situ snow thickness measurements
have been conducted in the western Arctic Ocean, demonstrating the utility of
the airborne data. However, there have been no validation studies in the
Atlantic sector of the Arctic. Recent observations in this region suggest a
significant and predominant shift towards a snow-ice regime, caused by deep
snow on thin sea ice. During the Norwegian young sea ICE expedition (N-ICE2015)
in the area north of Svalbard, a validation study was conducted on March 19,
2015, during which ground truth data were collected during an OIB overflight.
Snow and ice thickness measurements were obtained across a two dimensional
(2-D) 400 m × 60 m grid. Additional snow and ice thickness measurements
collected in situ from adjacent ice floes helped to place the measurements
obtained at the gridded survey field site into a more regional context.
Widespread negative freeboards and flooding of the snow pack were observed
during the N-ICE2015 expedition, due to the general situation of thick snow on
relatively thin sea ice. These conditions caused brine wicking and saturation
into the basal snow layers, causing more diffuse scattering and influenced the
airborne radar signal to detect the radar main scattering horizon well above
the snow/sea ice interface

Trends and spatial variation in rain-on-snow events over the Arctic Ocean
during the early melt season
https://tc.copernicus.org/preprints/tc-2020-214/

 Rain-on-snow (ROS) events can accelerate the surface ablation of sea ice, thus
greatly influencing the ice-albedo feedback. However, the variability of ROS
events over the Arctic Ocean is poorly understood due to limited historical
station data in this region. In this study early melt season ROS events were
investigated based on four widely-used reanalysis products (ERA-Interim,
JRA-55, MERRA2 and ERA5) in conjunction with available observations at Arctic
coastal stations. The performance of the reanalysis products in representing
the timing of ROS events and the phase change of precipitation was assessed.
Our results show that ERA-Interim better represents the onset date of ROS
events in spring and ERA5 better represents the phase change of precipitation
associated with ROS events. All reanalyses indicate that ROS event timing has
shifted to earlier dates in recent decades (with maximum trends up to −4 to −6
days/decade in some regions in ERA-Interim), and that sea ice melt onset in the
Pacific sector and most of the Eurasian marginal seas is correlated with this
shift. There has been a clear transition from solid to liquid precipitation,
leading to more ROS events in spring, although large discrepancies were found
between different reanalysis products. In ERA5, the shift from solid to liquid
precipitation phase during the early melt season has directly contributed to a
reduction in spring snow depth on sea ice by more than −0.5 cm/decade averaged
over the Arctic Ocean since 1980, with the largest contribution (about −2.0 cm/
decade) in the Kara-Barents Seas and Canadian Arctic Archipelago.

Methane cycling within sea ice; results from drifting ice during late spring,
north of Svalbard
https://tc.copernicus.org/preprints/tc-2020-208/tc-2020-208.pdf

Sea ice is an important component of the Arctic system playing a significant
role for gas exchange between ocean and atmosphere. However, global warming has
led to a sharp retreat of sea ice coverage in the Arctic Ocean during the last
decades. During 2019 sea ice covered 4.15 million km2 in summer representing a
decrease of 33 % compared to the 1981-2010 average (Perovich et al., 2019). The
negative downward trend in Arctic summer sea ice coverage has been observed for
more than 30 years. This tendency is expected to continue  over the next
decades   including a cascade of possible associated effects. In particular,
sea ice retreat may quickly induce enhanced methane (CH4) emissions into the
atmosphere due to the loss of its barrier function
for sea-air gas exchange. Because the Arctic holds large natural sources of
this highly potent
greenhouse gas, this effect has to be considered as positive feedback of global
warming. Moreover, the resulting decreased temporal flux retention of methane
under the ice reduces oxidation intensity to the less potent CO2

Seasonal changes in sea ice kinematics and deformation in the Pacific Sector of
the Arctic Ocean in 2018/19
https://tc.copernicus.org/preprints/tc-2020-211/

Arctic sea ice kinematics and deformation play significant roles in heat and
momentum exchange between atmosphere and ocean. However, mechanisms regulating
their changes at seasonal scales remain poorly understood. Using position data
of 32 buoys in the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean (PAO), we characterized
spatiotemporal variations in ice kinematics and deformation for autumn–winter
2018/19. In autumn, sea ice drift response to wind forcing and inertia were
stronger in the southern and western than in the northern and eastern parts of
the PAO. These spatial heterogeneities decreased gradually from autumn to
winter, in line with the seasonal evolution of ice concentration and thickness.
Areal localization index decreased by about 50 % from autumn to winter,
suggesting the enhanced localization of intense ice deformation as the
increased ice mechanical strength. In winter 2018/19, a highly positive Arctic
Dipole and a weakened high pressure system over the Beaufort Sea led to a
distinct change in ice drift direction and an temporary increase in ice
deformation. During the freezing season, ice deformation rate in the northern
part of the PAO was about 2.5 times that in the western part due to the higher
spatial heterogeneity of oceanic and atmospheric forcing in the north.
North–south and east–west gradients in sea ice kinematics and deformation of
the PAO observed in autumn 2018 are likely to become more pronounced in the
future as sea ice losses at higher rates in the western and southern than in
the northern and western parts.

Clouds damp the radiative impacts of polar sea ice loss
https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/14/2673/2020/

Clouds play an important role in the climate system: (1) cooling Earth by
reflecting incoming sunlight to space and (2) warming Earth by reducing thermal
energy loss to space. Cloud radiative effects are especially important in polar
regions and have the potential to significantly alter the impact of sea ice
decline on the surface radiation budget. Using CERES (Clouds and the Earth's
Radiant Energy System) data and 32 CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project) climate models, we quantify the influence of polar clouds on the
radiative impact of polar sea ice variability. Our results show that the cloud
short-wave cooling effect strongly influences the impact of sea ice variability
on the surface radiation budget and does so in a counter-intuitive manner over
the polar seas: years with less sea ice and a larger net surface radiative flux
show a more negative cloud radiative effect. Our results indicate that 66±2% of
this change in the net cloud radiative effect is due to the reduction in
surface albedo and that the remaining 34±1 % is due to an increase in cloud
cover and optical thickness. The overall cloud radiative damping effect is
56±2 % over the Antarctic and 47±3 % over the Arctic. Thus, present-day cloud
properties significantly reduce the net radiative impact of sea ice loss on the
Arctic and Antarctic surface radiation budgets. As a result, climate models
must accurately represent present-day polar cloud properties in order to
capture the surface radiation budget impact of polar sea ice loss and thus the
surface albedo feedback.

A linear model to derive melt pond depth on Arctic sea ice from hyperspectral
data
https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/14/2567/2020/

Melt ponds are key elements in the energy balance of Arctic sea ice. Observing
their temporal evolution is crucial for understanding melt processes and
predicting sea ice evolution. Remote sensing is the only technique that enables
large-scale observations of Arctic sea ice. However, monitoring melt pond
deepening in this way is challenging because most of the optical signal
reflected by a pond is defined by the scattering characteristics of the
underlying ice. Without knowing the influence of meltwater on the reflected
signal, the water depth cannot be determined. To solve the problem, we
simulated the way meltwater changes the reflected spectra of bare ice. We
developed a model based on the slope of the log-scaled remote sensing
reflectance at 710 nm as a function of depth that is widely independent from
the bottom albedo and accounts for the influence of varying solar zenith
angles. We validated the model using 49 in situ melt pond spectra and
corresponding depths from shallow ponds on dark and bright ice Our results
indicate that our model enables the accurate retrieval of pond depth on Arctic
sea ice from optical data under clear sky conditions without having to consider
pond bottom albedo. This technique is potentially transferrable to
hyperspectral remote sensors on unmanned aerial vehicles, aircraft and
satellites.

Surface-Based Ku- and Ka-band Polarimetric Radar for Sea Ice Studies
https://tc.copernicus.org/preprints/tc-2020-151/ Mosaic

To improve our understanding of how snow properties influence sea ice thickness
retrievals from presently operational and upcoming satellite radar altimeter
missions, as well as investigating the potential for combining dual frequencies
to simultaneously map snow depth and sea ice thickness, a new, surface-based,
fully-polarimetric Ku- and Ka-band radar (KuKa radar) was built and deployed
during the 2019–2020 year-long MOSAiC International Arctic drift expedition.
This instrument, built to operate both as an altimeter (stare mode) and a
scatterometer (scanning mode), provided the first in situ Ku- and Ka-band dual
frequency radar observations from autumn freeze-up through mid-winter, and
covering newly formed ice in leads, first-year and second-year ice floes. Data
gathered in the altimeter mode, will be used to investigate the potential for
estimating snow depth as the difference between dominant radar scattering
horizons in the Ka- and Ku-band data. In the scatterometer mode, the Ku- and
Ka-band radars operated under a wide range of azimuth and incidence angle
ranges, continuously assessing changes in the polarimetric radar backscatter
and derived polarimetric parameters, as snow properties varied under varying
atmospheric conditions. These observations allow for characterizing radar
backscatter responses to changes in atmospheric and surface geophysical
conditions. In this paper, we describe the KuKa radar and illustrate examples
of these data and demonstrate their potential for these investigations.

Simulated Ka- and Ku-band radar altimeter scattering horizon on snow-covered
Arctic sea ice
https://tc.copernicus.org/preprints/tc-2020-196/Surface-Based Ku- and Ka-band
Polarimetric Radar for Sea Ice Studies

Owing to differing and complex snow geophysical properties, radar waves of
different wavelengths undergo variable penetration through snow-covered sea
ice. However, the mechanisms influencing radar altimeter backscatter from
snow-covered sea ice, especially at Ka- and Ku-band frequencies, and its impact
on the Ka- and Ku-band radar scattering horizon or the "track point" (i.e. the
scattering layer depth detected by the radar re-tracker), are not well
understood. In this study, we evaluate the Ka- and Ku-band radar scattering
horizon with respect to radar penetration and ice floe buoyancy using a
first-order scattering model and Archimedes’ principle. Our simulations
demonstrate that the Ka- and Ku-band track point difference is a function of
snow depth, however, the simulated track point difference is much smaller than
what is reported in the literature from the CryoSat-2 Ku-band and SARAL/AltiKa
Ka-band satellite radar altimeter observations. We argue that this discrepancy
in the Ka- and Ku-band track point differences are sensitive to ice type and
snow depth and its associated geophysical properties. Snow salinity is first
increasing the Ka- and Ku-band track-point difference when the snow is thin and
then decreasing the difference when the snow is thick (> 10 cm). A relationship
between the Ku-band radar scattering horizon and snow depth is found. This
relationship has implications for 1) the use of snow climatology in the
conversion of radar freeboard into sea ice thickness and 2) the impact of
variability in measured snow depth on the derived ice thickness.

        EDIT: The speed of drift swings between 10% and 20% of normal walking
        speed. And the tidal swings are only a few hundred meters each way. The
        circular movement I guess has more to do with changing wind direction
        than anything else.


    Great. As you guessed that one hopefully you will run the numbers to prove
    it. Hourly wind direction from PS is here   P169 is near if you need buoy
    data.
    I suspect it is the combination of both since wind drift appears to be of
    the same order of magnitude as 'tidal drift' and it's a more likely
    explanation than continuous tight wind vortexes at multiples of walking
    speed. 

A guess does not need proof. Circular motion needs explanation, and I'm at a
loss to see what else it could be. Some sort of ocean current turbulence is of
course also a possibility, but less likely to my mind.

The drift speed is not at "multiples of walking speed" in normal parlance. Slow
strolling is 1m/s, while brisk walking is nearer to 1.5 m/s. The buyos drift
speed swings around 0.1 m/s. I'm not sure what you mean by "tidal drift", I
don't think such a thing exists. But the sideways pulsation of water every 6
hours sems to be in the region of a few hundred meters each way every 6 hours,
translating into a slow pendulum swing at 0.02 m/s.

Uniqorn's animation (repeated below) does not indicate any wind vortexes at any
speed. The twoo loops at the center of the image can be seen as a result of
slow drift closely aligned to the direcion of the tidal pulse. If we were to
remove the tidal factor, the buoy movement would paint a circle with a radius
of 1 or 2 km over a three day period. Changes in wind direction seems the most
likely explanation, but it is of course the surrounding ice that is moving and
the forces causing the changes in movement could just as well be found hundreds
of kms distant.

    Have you considered near-inertial oscillations?

No they haven't. I've suggested it multiple times though and provided the
semi-diurnal frequency using excel's spline fit to the discretized half hour
buoy data in the Yermak Plateau area. Uniq provides fresh data links in #1176
but no one followed through. Project SHEBA went to some lengths to observe this
effect; for a serious fluid dynamical treatment, the R Pinkel papers cover it.

From the recommended link above (Sea ice inertial oscillations in the Arctic
Basin by F. Gimbert et al 2012):

"The effect of the Coriolis force on geophysical fluid dynamics has been
studied for more than a century. Interestingly, the first studies of oceanic
inertial oscillations (Ekman, 1905) were prompted by the observations of
Nansen, made during the Fram’s journey along the Transpolar drift, that sea ice
was moving with a 20–40º angle to the right of the wind direction (Nansen,
1902).

"Indeed, as the Coriolis force acts perpendicularly to the particle velocity,
it induces a deviation of the trajectory to the right in the Northern
Hemisphere. This deviation generates inertial
oscillations, characterized by a frequency of f = 2 sin(latitude in radians)
cycles per day, close to a semi-diurnal frequency cycles per day in the
Arctic."

The sine function takes on the value 1 at 90º giving two 12 hour cycles per
day. After than it falls off slowly to zero at the equator. At Arctic
latitudes, the frequency falls off quite slowly but remains quite
distinguishable from tidal frequencies (not a big consideration at the
Polarstern's location).

A free online scan of Nansen 1902 is at the links below; amazon sells a hard
copy of the book for only $545.95. Despite text search, I have not been able to
locate Nansen actually saying anything about ice drift angle with respect to
wind direction. That seems to have been discussed only in volume III of
Nansen's report (which is exhausively detailed) and only available for $35.

        drift update from P176.
        2 submarine landslides a day seems unlikely. I think I'll stick with
        tides.

    Absolutely (grrmble grrmble) and the gif is fantastic, almost like a Micky
    Mouse picture.<snippage>

No update from meereisportal buoys today.
Now, how to identify an inertial oscillation ice drift component, a tidal ice
drift component and a wind driven ice drift component?
Note that the more northerly mickey mouse is flatter than the others.

Amazing! I must admit that I have never heard of this inertial oscillation
phenomenon. So no, I had not considered it ...

From the paper u300673 linked to above, and from A-Team's excellent post (as
how could it not be) it seems that tidal oscillation and inertial oscillation
have the same frequency and can easily be confused with each other.

Quote from: Sea ice inertial oscillations in the Arctic Basin

    As the Arctic Basin lies between 70◦ and 90◦ of latitude, the inertial
    oscillation frequency varies from −1.88 to −2 cycles day−1 at these
    latitudes and is thus merged with the semi-diurnal tidal oscillation
    frequency. The differentiation of these two types of oscillations can be
    done by looking at the amplitude of the Fourier spectrum with respect to
    signed frequencies ...


So having considered inertial oscillation I find it easy to dismiss - it cannot
explain the cyclical path of the buoy and so we are back to my first guess of
changes in wind direction.

The inertial oscillation phenomenon is new to me, too.  But I suspect the
quasi-circular motion of the buoys may depend on a confluence of
factors--tides, inertial oscillation, wind, and also ocean turbulence with
vortex formation.  The last might be the dominant factor here, just my guess. 
In a region where vast flows are moving both north and south, vortex formation
is inevitable.  And vortices are circular in motion.

Vortex effect: it either engulfs all the buoys in which case we would observe
all buoys also rotating around a common center, or many vortices would be
affecting the different buoys in which case the movement synchronicity would be
lost.
So this factor must be really small

frequencies and isolate translation and different modes of oscillation (x and y
in phase or 180) or rotation (x and y in +/- 90 deg phase) in the 2D plane.
The wind drift won’t have a frequency in resonance with Earth rotation
frequency (day)

Yes, you're right here.  My thinking hadn't fully developed on the
possibility.  I'm sure there are lots of vortices in the region, but you're
right that this idea does not explain the observed motion.

Today will be the last day of bow radar. Note how the motion of the little floe
is constrained by the walls of the lead around it, literally a boundary
condition. This will also be the case at larger scales for the floe(s) bearing
the buoys.

The little floe broke off 6 days ago and has been bouncing around ever since.
What specifically accounts for its motions relative to the enveloping pack?
Well, that would bring in some mix of all of the above.

FOMO screwed up royally again today, confusing Ctenophore with Cnidaria. These
are different phyla that diverged in the late pre-Cambrian. 'Comb jellies' are
very different beasts from 'jellyfish', they're only superficially related.
Scientists have been working on the early evolution of Metazoa for centuries
--  so inappropriate to ignore all that previous work and stub in ignorance on
a public outreach site.

The ctenophore genomes of Mnemiopsis leidyi and Pleurobrachia bachei are much
studied to understand the origin of vision and the nervous system, not to
mention G-coupled protein receptors (the target of 50% of all human
pharmaceuticals).

The silly discussion above on what could be the cause of the circular movement
of the buyo, i.e. the path shown in green below, has lead to a major discovery
for me, and to a serious conundrum:

Are all of the "tidal movements" that uniqorn has been showing us in fact only
"inertial oscillations"? Or only some of them? Which ones? How can we tell?

As A-Team has so boldly stated, tidal movement is negligible in the Arctic (or
more precisely: Around Mosaic). Personally I have been of the same opinion
regarding tides, but uniqorn did seem to have proved the opposite with his
fantastic animations.

So what are we in fact looking at in all the wirls and curves around the green
path line? Is it only the ice doing it's inertial oscillations on top of the
ocean surface, is it the ocean itself inertially oscillating, is it the tidal
pulse shifting waters back and forth or what?

I've made a very lukewarm search of tidal movements of Argo floats which would
be incredibly interesting for comparison. Can tidal movement be seen at all in
the drift of a typical Argo float in the North Atlantic (one of the strongest
tidal areas) let alone in a near-todally-dead tidal zone such as the
Mediterranean or the Arctic? What would the tidal signal look like in a buyo
floating free of the ice pack?

All questions way above my pay grade.

I’d say there’s only one rotational mvmt of significance superposed to the
green line, the red looks to me like a cycloid wrapped around. Is that the
secondary oscillation that appears as the floe moves due to inertia-coriolis
imbalance with 1/2 day period?

AKA inertial oscillation. This is exactly the question in my mind too - has
uniqorn been showing us animations of tidal oscillation or inertial
oscillation? And does that mean that there is no (or at the very most
negligible) tidal movement in the Arctic?

    negligible) tidal movement in the Arctic?

You may be right binntho. The drift paths from the F Gimbert paper look very
similar to the buoy animations except for a larger possible component of
inertial oscillation this year. The maths is above my pay grade also but I may
work up to it in time. I think tides have a part to play in the arctic, more
importantly at the shelf breaks. An increase in inertial oscillation due to
thinning and fractured ice cover adds another (previously unknown to me)
feedback loop that deserves more consideration from the forum.

Also shown is P163 drift speed. Calculating the time between 12 peaks in the
centre gave an average of 23.29hrs/peak which is too short for a lunar cycle so
I'm open to other explanations.
P163
09 06 2200 to 09 12 1330
279.5hours, 12peaks = 23.29hrs/peak

I may take a look at north Atlantic buoys on another thread though a comparison
of some in the central arctic from previous years would be more interesting.
Meanwhile here are some of the remaining Mosaic buoys in the Greenland Sea. awi
amsr2 inset to show rough ice location. (graticule belongs to the animation)

    inertial oscillations

These papers go back to the 1960's if not earlier. I added some classics over
at the wave forum.
https://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,2417.msg287387.html#msg287387

The Polarstern has left its second floe for Bremerhaven, escaping the
encroaching pole hole of darkness but also missing a lot of the early freezing
system, not completing a full cycle which would take staying until Oct 4th.

The ship's progress can be followed by pasting lat lon data from awiMet into
the excel template containing the haversine distance formula, the elapsed time
between reports (hrs are commonly skipped), and a velocity column as we do for
buoys.

However since the accuracy provided is poor, it is easier for eyeball estimates
just to count the hours between 0.1 drops in latitude which represent 11.1 km
of progress to the ice edge. Over the last 24 hours, those are 3,2
,6,3,3,2,5.2,1,1,1,2,1,1 so the speed has been running at 2-11 km/hr.

In other words, there has been some 2m ice but lately favorable leads and lower
compression ice where the ship can make rapid progress. The PS is rated at 28.7
km/hr for calm open seas so 11 km/hr indicates very insubstantial ice for the
last 80 km despite the very high latitudes.

They are dropping longitude as opportunity presents as this gives a shorter
path to the unconsolidated ice north of the the edge, as well as representing
the homebound direction. The ship should emerge from the WorldView and
Sentinel-1B pole holes late tomorrow.

The AMSR2_AWI shows the averaged concentration (relative to the palette) for
the last 16th days. The red line shows its envelope, areas outside have been
entirely open water the entire time. (This is a gimp trick to determine minimum
crop boundaries for long time series.)

There's no significance to this unless the ship gets stuck or stops for a few
days to observe conditions near the ice edge.
 
Update: The ship is making much faster time now, with only one hour between
88.2 and 87.5. Will they share any of the transiting data on ice thickness and
condition? (No.)

Update: The Polarstern has covered 206km  in the last 24 hours ending 20-09-22
21:00 for an incredible average speed -- through 'solid ice' of 8.6 km/hr
perhaps aided by a 17m/s gale force tailwind that may be diminishing ice
compression. Just paste the two lat lon in the first two columns and rows of
any spreadsheet and the haversine formula in R1C3...

=ACOS(COS(RADIANS(90-A1)) *COS(RADIANS(90-A2)) +SIN(RADIANS(90-A1)) *SIN

BBC seems to have some inside info.  I have looked back on this Forum but have
found no mention of this in particular. 
You need to read further down the article to see the quotes from Julienne
Stroeve on her Mosaic mission:

    news in the BBC piece?

We've been considering two new articles from J Stroeve that appeared in The
Cryosphere in the the last month. This sounds like a third Mosaic-specific
version is coming soon. The news (?) is that Cryosat has a significant
thickness bias that cannot properly account for a snow cover.

Was 4.5 months out in the cold and dark, cut off from internet productivity, a
good use of Stroeve's and other principal scientists' time? I would say it was
not.

So here we go with yet another satellite (Cristal) that promises to do it
better, in part using new measurements from the Mosaic year. Here it sounds
like it will measure reflectance of two simultaneous microwave frequencies in
the Ku and Ka bands. That is WWII terminology for 12–18 GHz and 33.4-36.0 GHz.

While ice thickness and volume have always been the Achilles heel of Arctic
remote sensing, it is necessary to get at it by satellite observation because
models can't do it satisfactorily and  ships cannot always be out there. Indeed
even supplemented with buoys, plane overflights and touch-and-go sampling, they
cannot provide comprehensive sampling.

Indeed Cryosat takes a month of orbits to get one round of swath assembly. So I
would guess design of Cristal is not just accurate freeboard but equally about
getting a wider swath so fewer orbits are needed to build a picture (done in
part by having two satellites). 

Freeboard does not give thickness except with the assumptions of ice density
and buoyant equilibrium. How well does that work with under-ice melt ponds,
porous ice, incomplete brine exclusion, undrained deep melt ponds, flooded
negative freeboard floes, repeatedlymelted and refrozen snow and so on?

It is still years away from launch in 2027 so the question could be raised
whether the Arctic ice of its time will be a good match to the design indicated
by Polarstern research of ice of last winter.

'Thickness' alone may not really characterizes critical properties of the ice
even today -- there were too many surprises this melting season. Will snow
depth be the focus or will we be wishing we had a rain-on-snow satellite -- or
just ordinary rain gauges on a giant fleet of buoys that could be deployed any
time for far less expenditure?

https://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,2906.msg287133.html#msg287133

Trends and spatial variation in rain-on-snow events over Arctic Ocean during
early melt season
https://tc.copernicus.org/preprints/tc-2020-214/

"CRISTAL -- Copernicus polar ice and snow topography -- will carry a
multi-frequency radar altimeter and microwave radiometer to measure and monitor
sea-ice thickness and overlying snow depth. It would also measure and monitor
changes in the height of ice sheets and glaciers around the world thanks to its
interferometric radar mode.

IRIS will significantly improve the measurement accuracy of its predecessor
SIRAL-2 (a Ku band only altimeter on board ESA’s CryoSat-2 Earth Explorer
mission) thanks to the dual frequency operation and by adding the measurement
of sea surface height as part of the mission objectives.

The drifting polar orbit is 760km above the Earth. Its on-board memory will be
able to store up to 4 terabits of science data during its 7.5 year lifetime."

    I think tides have a part to play in the arctic, more importantly at the
    shelf breaks.

I agree. But perhaps it is a part that is not easily visible to us.

Quote

    Also shown is P163 drift speed. Calculating the time between 12 peaks in
    the centre gave an average of 23.29hrs/peak which is too short for a lunar
    cycle so I'm open to other explanations.


But fits well with an inertial oscillation (IO) at slightly less than 2 per day
this close to the pole. From my reading I gather that the IO goes from 2/day at
90N to 0 at the equator.

Quote

    Meanwhile here are some of the remaining Mosaic buoys in the Greenland Sea.

Not really possible to discern any tidal oscillation, perhaps the scale is too
large. We know that there is a larger tidal effect here than in the Arctic,
although not all that large (you need to go south of the
Greenland-Iceland-Scotland line to get into proper tidal movement). The maximum
tidal movement in Longyearbyen is around 2m, in Reykjavik it is almost 5m. Out
in the open ocean, the movement is signifcantly less, perhaps 0.5m in the
Greenland sea, 1 - 1.5m just south of Iceland.

Any volunteers to keep an eye on a new snow buoy, 2020S98, close the the pole?

Also 2020S106, 2020S107 and Also 2020S108
The ever improving meereisportal makes it visually simple.

For latest lat/lon it is still necessary to look at the data tables.
meereisportal here

or the iabp daily table here
though you need to know the buoyID
for example

I think you mean just north of 86 north old boy?
That slush pic in their wake was at 88.3 just after they left on the 20th btw.
I think the Cap'n thunk the kids needed a bit of a reality check by scaring
them to think they were going to run head on into a Beaufort 9 storm front with
wave and swell chaos in the shelf fragments and skyscraper sized  Bergs on the
edge of the ice front.
Instead he has turned ninety degrees due West to run with it.
They've copped the force nine thunderstorm hot front on the butt. But so far
have no idea what force 9 sea states near coasts look like. He may blood them
with that experience in the next few days.
This auld Ships Cap'n do. Me bin coastal on sail in force twelve Gustin to
180kmph. And experienced the site of 100+ ft rolling breakers from one horizon
to the other coming in from the southern ocean at 60 second period all day
long. Wavelength some 3km and velocity over 200kmph in the deep where they
spawned, the beasties!

The Polarstern continues to hug the 86th parallel for the last [DEL:28:DEL] 39
hours, holding at 86.0  59.5. This cannot be because of thick ice as they have
come 214 km at an average speed of 7.6 km/hr at mild temperatures, mist/drizzle
and moderating winds after the brush with the first Barents cyclone. Daylight
is fading fast right at their location, 3rd image below.

Note this is just great circle haversine(first,last) distance and not on the
ellipsoid; parallels are not great circles for either datum; adding up track
segments would give a greater distance in fewer hours of actual movement and so
considerably higher speed, implying little resistance from the ice despite its
100% concentration.

Presumably the ship is now moored or at least idling at a floe of interest
after doing some unscheduled study of weather, water and ice at constant
longitude. FOMO mentions sending up weather balloons at six hour intervals up
to 35km on each of the 370 days of the trip but nothing specific to the 86º.
FOMO today is a week back, showing the massive open lead out of all context.

GFS is showing precip bands associated with the cyclones; going by the
temperatures, these are an undifferentiated mix of rain, freezing rain and
snow; which matters quite a bit for the ice.

They could angle down later through the gap between FJL and Sv to reach
Bremerhaven which seems likelier than going down the Fram to the bad weather of
the North Atlantic but that means continuing west to the 45th meridian or so.

That is great. Even if it ends up proving me wrong I like more information.

The Polarstern is proceeding again along its 86º transect in newly graduated
SYI after pausing for 16 hours. The ship is due north of western FJL so could
cut over later today to the gap with Svalbard. Possibly they wish to intersect
their previous drift location with the original floe before heading home.

Bow radar shows a surprising amount of open water consistent with the ice
showing limited sub-100% concentration on AMSR2_AWI. The patches are small
relative to the 3x3 km pixels but still seem to contribute. Smos-SMAP over
OsiSaf shows ice less than 0.5m thick not recently moving much at the PS
location.

Update: they've stopped again at 86.0 35.5 on 20-09-26, must be taking some
samples along  this preferred parallel, interesting concept.

Update: they've stopped again to award themselves another award:

Because the ice is so thin and mechanically weak, the Polarstern is able to
make very good time. The ship needs to stick to its Bremerhaven arrival
schedule of Oct 4th but is thus able to make additional stops at ice stations,
which they are able to schedule along the 86th parallel.

None of the data will be shared, even routine observations like ice thickness
along the long transects, because informing the current melt/freeze season in
nrt has never been a priority. Indeed, disclosure is verboten. Some data types,
like L25 in sea ice diatoms, aren't suitable for sharing as they need to be
measured back at land labs.

In theory, the PS could continue along 86.0 until the Greenwich meridian which
would involve another 2-3 days of travel including brief ice station stops from
their current longitude of 31.5º. Winds are picking up though and possibly
blowing them somewhat south. It's not clear the ship will exit through the Fram
or have time for observations if they do.

Update 1: the ship has turned south under steam, attaining ~33 km in 4 hours
along the 32nd meridian. They could reach Bremerhaven in 4-5 days if they don't
stop at the ice edge for another station.

Update 2: the Polarstern has advanced 111 km south in the last 10 hours to
84.3  32.1 so will be crossing the ice edge into open water in a couple of
hours. Bow radar is already showing large patches of open water as of midnight
on the 26th. The weather is unfavorable for a final ice station given the 14m/s
wind, cold, precip and low light conditions so this is effectively the end of
the Mosaic expedition (except for working up the data into publications).

Update 3: they have stopped right at the ice edge for 5-6 hours, 20-09-28 at
01:00, 4th image.


The ice photo is apparently from Thursday, Sept 24th. The melt ponds are frozen
over enough to stand on but do not have a coat of snow. Bootprints can be seen
in 5cm snow that seems mushy. Bow radar caught ice motion at one of the ice
stations.

It's worth pondering whether a future expedition could make complete loops at
fixed latitude in August, say at 85-87º. This might require a dedicated
contract icebreaker for the CAB portions with the Polarstern following close
behind to spare fuel. What though would be the scientific rationale for doing
constant latitudinal circuits?

The top-of-cloud insolation would be held constant though it would vary down on
the ice, along with air temperature. The coriolis effect would also be constant
in magnitude but then it varies very little at high latitudes (it goes as the
sine of latidude; the sine function barely budges at large angles). Wind
patterns and origins would vary greatly. On the whole, it does not seem holding
one variable constant really helps isolate the others for study.

This is quite creative use of the last week before heading for port, in some
ways more interesting than just studying a single possibly unrepresentative
floe. The Polarstern can do CTD casts, ice thickness, and water temperature
while on the move.

With periodic stops on the the 86º transect, the various teams can go out and
take cores, water samples and weather parameters in the boundary layer and
above. The new twist is going back and forth across the marginal ice zone (ice
edge) to study conditions allowing new ice formation (which as usual takes
place laterally along the periphery of the existing ice side.

The "position buoys" that coordinate with the Polar5/6 overflight campaign
haven't been mentioned before. Normally, the teams out on the ice try to
coordinate with the time of the overflight but that could not happen this year
as access to the base airport in Svalbard only became available at the last
moment (because of virus).

Update 1: 81.6  11.6 20-09-29 14:00  14m/s -2.9ºC. The ship has left the ice
edge for good and is heading down the Fram to study the position buoy floes
before heading to the destination fjord in Svalbard. FOMO is showing engine
room pictures again. The wind up the Strait is strong but there is no ice above
it to be imported.

Update 1: 81.7 1.6 20-09-30  09:00 12m/s -5.7ºC. The PS is in the middle of the
Fram west of Svalbard doing another 24 hour constant-latitude transect to
synergize with Polar 5/6 flights earlier this month. Winds are still blowing
north at near gale force..

By AWIPEV, they mean the joint German-French portion of the large research
station at Ny-Ålesund, Alfred Wegener and Institute Paul Emile Victor (a
Greenland explorer). Some eleven countries do field and lab work there on the
ocean, ice tundra, glaciers, troposphere, stratosphere, magnetosphere where
there is a benefit (or necessity) to be so far north at 79º.  It's not clear
what's involved with Mosaic to 'exchange material" with AWIPEV.

The links below describe some of the research going on. One study is looking
how to protect GPS accuracy at high latitude from ionosphere disturbance.

Some interesting detail has emerged about the Polar5/6 flights out of Svalbard
that could have been a major component of Mosaic had they been fully executable
as initially planned.

The idea with these Arctic-adapted planes which can fly as low as 100m is to
close the resolution gap between detailed but very costly ground exploration
and large-scale remote sensing from satellites (whose view is often obscured by
cloud tops).

The MACS camera mounted underneath Polar 6 is an amazing device that captures
high resolution ice detail simultaneously in the visible, near infrared and
thermal infrared. Some 300,000 images at a frame rate of four per second have
been taken in the first flights, meaning serious AI is necessary for processing
and interpretation.

The camera was developed and operated by DLR (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und
Raumfahrt) which is similar to NASA and a separate organization from AWI/
Helmholtz but participating in Mosaic.

DLR provides a single example on their web page for 84ºN 6ºE in September;
there is no link to an archive. This would be truly massive given the number of
scenes at the ground resolutions mentioned. No serious description of scene or
camera specs is given. A DLR image on twitter has dimension 4096 x 2722 pixels.

https://www.dlr.de/content/en/articles/news/2020/03/
20200915_studying-ice-at-the-centimetre-scale.html

The visible is said to measure roughness of the ice and snow; elsewhere this
unit has been run as stereo triples which could map pressure ridges but here
seems to rely on low angle sun shadows. The near-infrared images provide
automatic discrimination of water from floe at 2 cm resolution; the thermal
infrared images show temperature differences between ice and freezing fissures
at 40 cm.

The conventional thermal palette does not seem optimal for interpretation as a
glasbey palette more clearly shows geometric rim features of some of the melt
ponds.

Meanwhile, Polar 5 is outfitted quite differently to do cloud and atmospheric
research such as determine droplet size distribution, analyze ice crystal
shapes, ice and liquid water content of mixed phase clouds and factors relevant
to cloud formation. Again the route follows the Polarstern ice station route to
synergize with field data. No sample data is available.

The Polarstern seems to be moored in a Svalbard fjord for the exchange of
material (ice cores?) with the AWIPEV lab in Ny-Ålesund. No purpose would be
served by following the expedition back to Bremerhaven.

Nothing new emerged looking today for published expedition research at The
Cryosphere preprints and Google Scholar (for 'Mosaic Arctic'). Articles will be
dribbling in for 3-4 years, thus not terribly helpful for nrt understanding of
2019-20.

It is possible that some areas of the big central database will open earlier
than 2023 or at least be discussed on Meereis forums or insider twitter
accounts.

Three new blogs have appeared on the ticker site:
https://www.meereisportal.de/en/mosaic/sea-ice-ticker/

'Non-Sentinel-1AB high-resolution satellite SAR images had to be ordered two
days in advance with precise lat lon information for floe 2.0. To provide that
information, drift forecasts relied on the Sea Ice Drift Forecast Experiment
SIDFEx  [[despite its total failure in predicting the very rapid TPD drift last
spring that ruined the Mosaic program design] That did ok on a 7-day spaghetti
forecast for 19 – 26 September zonally but missed the meridional as wind
forecasts are only good 3-4 days out.]. For the 120-day forecast, we largely
expect to see a southwest drift that generally follows the Transpolar Drift
Stream [[duh]]".

https://swift.dkrz.de/v1/dkrz_0262ea1f00e34439850f3f1d71817205/SIDFEx_Graphical
/SIDFEx_Polarstern_Graphical_floe2_latest.pdf

"On 21 August the MOSAiC Team set up a new Ice Camp for the fifth leg of the
expedition at ca. 87° 43’ N and 104° 30’ E. On 20 September we then left (were
forced to leave) the second floe. Here, too, a network of autonomous buoys,
smaller than the first, was deployed on the main floe and in its vicinity, and
was once again left behind. 

On the central floe, the Sea Ice Team deployed three sets of buoys, outfitted
with complex systems for observing various parameters: in Met City there are
snow and ice buoys, as well as a buoy for monitoring flows and turbulences,
from the ocean to the atmosphere. A second station, set up on level ice,
focuses on energy flows and optical properties, as well as the mass balance for
snow and sea ice.

We also installed buoys in the pressure ridge near the ship’s bow, which are
above all used to compare the distribution of snow there to the distribution on
level ice. There are also three cameras among the buoys, which offer us a daily
record of the conditions on site. [[no links provided to cam archive]]

Beyond the main floe, 28 buoys were installed on smaller individual floes: 20
in its immediate vicinity (up to 10 km away) and the remainder as far as 40 km
away. One of the buoys was deployed at the North Pole itself, and another near
the sea-ice edge."

Extent on 31 August was 4.19 million km² and had declined by ca. 1.85 million
km² – an area roughly the size of about 5 times the size of Germany. In the
second half of August and until mid of September, a strong ice retreat was
observed in the Canadian Basin, which led so far to the lowest ice extent of
3.784 million km² on 09 September this summer.

Meteorological conditions in July and August included a distinct temperature
anomaly over the Central Arctic producing fluctuations in air temperatures at
925 hPa (~760 m; note they make no use of DMI 80 or its 2m temperatures) of
more than 6°C above the long-term average for the years 1981 to 2010 notably in
July, when the high-pressure cell was directly over Siberia. A detailed
assessment of this year's sea ice minimum is given here:

What becomes of all these thousands of weather balloons? They burst in the
upper atmosphere after two hours of reporting and fall to earth with their
instrument package, usually far from the launch site and unrecoverable.

Some latex ones are said biodegradable but that seems highly implausible at
Arctic temperatures; many would just sink to the ocean bottom along with their
ewaste. A staggering number are released each year by various countries, 22,630
in 2018 just from Canada. Birthday balloons are coated mylar (not
biodegradable) and found everywhere in parks, deserts and wilderness of the US.

And thx to Uniquorn for getting this forum off the ground and contributing so
much to buoy and other visualizations!

The wartime secrecy surrounding mundane data such as ship location, ice
thickness, experimental layout, timestamps on photos, weather balloons etc etc
was astonishing -- who was the enemy?

Not our melt and freeze forums. The enemy was the rest of the scientific
community who might, most implausibly, steal data and publish first or worse,
publish better. Wars always bring civilian casualties -- here the collateral
damage was to public understanding of climate change.

They missed a great opportunity at the north pole, dropping memorializing trash
and passing out souvenir water instead of doing scientific work, then rushing
on for a short stay at a meaningless secondary floe. This year's ice mobility
and melt ponds were especially auspicious for reaching the public, that didn't
happen.

The public paid for the entirety of this expedition (includes $25 million from
US public). If these scientists wish to do private science, let them pay for it
out of their own pocket. In terms of ducking responsibility for public
understanding of climate change (stale papers published in 2023 have zero
impact), silence from scientists simply does not work.

Mosaic floated the preposterous notion that policy makers will read these 2023
papers and make the needed inferences about climate change abatement. Mosaic is
an extreme version of controversy avoidance and seeking the least drama -- the
scientists involved are fully aware it's already too late for the Arctic.

AWI is not an educational institution; even though everyone on staff lists
themselves as professor, there are no students. Outreach was self-promotional
and mis-directed, not overseen by anyone with a scientific background and often
wrong.

Anything that went amiss -- and inevitably a lot did given the unexpected drift
and floe shifts -- was strictly sanitized to present an unrelenting smiley face
to the world. Information did emerge but was scattered all over Twitter and
institutional blogs with no central directory.

I've attached their final weather summary. Like all graphics to date, it's done
ineptly (eg scaling, wind rose, summary stats). The data going into is attached
as a text file if someone wants to work on it. The source web page could
disappear with the end of the expedition; the data will be retained but as a
deep dive into archival petabytes.

    And thx to Uniquorn for getting this forum off the ground and contributing
    so much to buoy and other visualizations!

Thanks, Uniquorn and A-Team for all the images that you were able to pull out
of this award winning expedition.

Update: they've stopped again to award themselves another award:

To those of us who have worked to communicate the science and stories of the
climate crisis to the public, this mission was bitterly disappointing, but that
was never the goal or even a concern. They did what they intended to do and are
proud of it.

Congratulations for all that helped in this thread with data and opinions.
Specially uniquorn and A-team (because these are the ones I remember the most).
I read most of the posts over the last year, and it was great to know the
insides and outs of this expedition thanks to you guys.
Everyone is going to try and make sense of the generated data, most amiss
conclusions will be contaminated with fear.

    <>has uniqorn been showing us animations of tidal oscillation or inertial
    oscillation? And does that mean that there is no (or at the very most
    negligible) tidal movement in the Arctic?

You may be right binntho. The drift paths from the F Gimbert paper look very
similar to the buoy animations except for a larger possible component of
inertial oscillation this year. The maths is above my pay grade also but I may
work up to it in time. I think tides have a part to play in the arctic, more
importantly at the shelf breaks. An increase in inertial oscillation due to
thinning and fractured ice cover adds another (previously unknown to me)
feedback loop that deserves more consideration from the forum.

Also shown is P163 drift speed. Calculating the time between 12 peaks in the
centre gave an average of 23.29hrs/peak which is too short for a lunar cycle so
I'm open to other explanations.
P163
09 06 2200 to 09 12 1330
279.5hours, 12peaks = 23.29hrs/peak

I may take a look at north Atlantic buoys on another thread though a comparison
of some in the central arctic from previous years would be more interesting.
Meanwhile here are some of the remaining Mosaic buoys in the Greenland Sea. awi

    inertial oscillations

These papers go back to the 1960's if not earlier. I added some classics over
at the wave forum.
https://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,2417.msg287387.html#msg287387

The Polarstern has left its second floe for Bremerhaven, escaping the
encroaching pole hole of darkness but also missing a lot of the early freezing
system, not completing a full cycle which would take staying until Oct 4th.

The ship's progress can be followed by pasting lat lon data from awiMet into
the excel template containing the haversine distance formula, the elapsed time
between reports (hrs are commonly skipped), and a velocity column as we do for
buoys.

However since the accuracy provided is poor, it is easier for eyeball estimates
just to count the hours between 0.1 drops in latitude which represent 11.1 km
of progress to the ice edge. Over the last 24 hours, those are 3,2
,6,3,3,2,5.2,1,1,1,2,1,1 so the speed has been running at 2-11 km/hr.

In other words, there has been some 2m ice but lately favorable leads and lower
compression ice where the ship can make rapid progress. The PS is rated at 28.7
km/hr for calm open seas so 11 km/hr indicates very insubstantial ice for the
last 80 km despite the very high latitudes.

They are dropping longitude as opportunity presents as this gives a shorter
path to the unconsolidated ice north of the the edge, as well as representing
the homebound direction. The ship should emerge from the WorldView and
Sentinel-1B pole holes late tomorrow.

The AMSR2_AWI shows the averaged concentration (relative to the palette) for
the last 16th days. The red line shows its envelope, areas outside have been
entirely open water the entire time. (This is a gimp trick to determine minimum
crop boundaries for long time series.)

There's no significance to this unless the ship gets stuck or stops for a few
days to observe conditions near the ice edge.
 
Update: The ship is making much faster time now, with only one hour between
88.2 and 87.5. Will they share any of the transiting data on ice thickness and
condition? (No.)

Update: The Polarstern has covered 206km  in the last 24 hours ending 20-09-22
21:00 for an incredible average speed -- through 'solid ice' of 8.6 km/hr
perhaps aided by a 17m/s gale force tailwind that may be diminishing ice
compression. Just paste the two lat lon in the first two columns and rows of
any spreadsheet and the haversine formula in R1C3...

=ACOS(COS(RADIANS(90-A1)) *COS(RADIANS(90-A2)) +SIN(RADIANS(90-A1)) *SIN

BBC seems to have some inside info.  I have looked back on this Forum but have
found no mention of this in particular. 
You need to read further down the article to see the quotes from Julienne
Stroeve on her Mosaic mission:

    news in the BBC piece?

We've been considering two new articles from J Stroeve that appeared in The
Cryosphere in the the last month. This sounds like a third Mosaic-specific
version is coming soon. The news (?) is that Cryosat has a significant
thickness bias that cannot properly account for a snow cover.

Was 4.5 months out in the cold and dark, cut off from internet productivity, a
good use of Stroeve's and other principal scientists' time? I would say it was
not.

So here we go with yet another satellite (Cristal) that promises to do it
better, in part using new measurements from the Mosaic year. Here it sounds
like it will measure reflectance of two simultaneous microwave frequencies in
the Ku and Ka bands. That is WWII terminology for 12–18 GHz and 33.4-36.0 GHz.

While ice thickness and volume have always been the Achilles heel of Arctic
remote sensing, it is necessary to get at it by satellite observation because
models can't do it satisfactorily and  ships cannot always be out there. Indeed
even supplemented with buoys, plane overflights and touch-and-go sampling, they
cannot provide comprehensive sampling.

Indeed Cryosat takes a month of orbits to get one round of swath assembly. So I
would guess design of Cristal is not just accurate freeboard but equally about
getting a wider swath so fewer orbits are needed to build a picture (done in
part by having two satellites). 

Freeboard does not give thickness except with the assumptions of ice density
and buoyant equilibrium. How well does that work with under-ice melt ponds,
porous ice, incomplete brine exclusion, undrained deep melt ponds, flooded
negative freeboard floes, repeatedlymelted and refrozen snow and so on?

It is still years away from launch in 2027 so the question could be raised
whether the Arctic ice of its time will be a good match to the design indicated
by Polarstern research of ice of last winter.

'Thickness' alone may not really characterizes critical properties of the ice
even today -- there were too many surprises this melting season. Will snow
depth be the focus or will we be wishing we had a rain-on-snow satellite -- or
just ordinary rain gauges on a giant fleet of buoys that could be deployed any
time for far less expenditure?

https://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,2906.msg287133.html#msg287133

Trends and spatial variation in rain-on-snow events over Arctic Ocean during
early melt season
https://tc.copernicus.org/preprints/tc-2020-214/

"CRISTAL -- Copernicus polar ice and snow topography -- will carry a
multi-frequency radar altimeter and microwave radiometer to measure and monitor
sea-ice thickness and overlying snow depth. It would also measure and monitor
changes in the height of ice sheets and glaciers around the world thanks to its
interferometric radar mode.

IRIS will significantly improve the measurement accuracy of its predecessor
SIRAL-2 (a Ku band only altimeter on board ESA’s CryoSat-2 Earth Explorer
mission) thanks to the dual frequency operation and by adding the measurement
of sea surface height as part of the mission objectives.

The drifting polar orbit is 760km above the Earth. Its on-board memory will be
able to store up to 4 terabits of science data during its 7.5 year lifetime."

I agree. But perhaps it is a part that is not easily visible to us.

    Also shown is P163 drift speed. Calculating the time between 12 peaks in
    the centre gave an average of 23.29hrs/peak which is too short for a lunar
    cycle so I'm open to other explanations.


But fits well with an inertial oscillation (IO) at slightly less than 2 per day
this close to the pole. From my reading I gather that the IO goes from 2/day at
90N to 0 at the equator.

Quote

    Meanwhile here are some of the remaining Mosaic buoys in the Greenland Sea.

Not really possible to discern any tidal oscillation, perhaps the scale is too
large. We know that there is a larger tidal effect here than in the Arctic,
although not all that large (you need to go south of the
Greenland-Iceland-Scotland line to get into proper tidal movement). The maximum
tidal movement in Longyearbyen is around 2m, in Reykjavik it is almost 5m. Out
in the open ocean, the movement is signifcantly less, perhaps 0.5m in the
Greenland sea, 1 - 1.5m just south of Iceland.

Any volunteers to keep an eye on a new snow buoy, 2020S98, close the the pole?

Also 2020S106, 2020S107 and Also 2020S108
The ever improving meereisportal makes it visually simple.

For latest lat/lon it is still necessary to look at the data tables.
meereisportal here

or the iabp daily table here
though you need to know the buoyID

I think you mean just north of 86 north old boy?
That slush pic in their wake was at 88.3 just after they left on the 20th btw.
I think the Cap'n thunk the kids needed a bit of a reality check by scaring
them to think they were going to run head on into a Beaufort 9 storm front with

The Polarstern continues to hug the 86th parallel for the last [DEL:28:DEL] 39
hours, holding at 86.0  59.5. This cannot be because of thick ice as they have
come 214 km at an average speed of 7.6 km/hr at mild temperatures, mist/drizzle
and moderating winds after the brush with the first Barents cyclone. Daylight
is fading fast right at their location, 3rd image below.

Note this is just great circle haversine(first,last) distance and not on the
ellipsoid; parallels are not great circles for either datum; adding up track
segments would give a greater distance in fewer hours of actual movement and so
considerably higher speed, implying little resistance from the ice despite its
100% concentration.

Presumably the ship is now moored or at least idling at a floe of interest
after doing some unscheduled study of weather, water and ice at constant
longitude. FOMO mentions sending up weather balloons at six hour intervals up
to 35km on each of the 370 days of the trip but nothing specific to the 86º.
FOMO today is a week back, showing the massive open lead out of all context.

GFS is showing precip bands associated with the cyclones; going by the
temperatures, these are an undifferentiated mix of rain, freezing rain and
snow; which matters quite a bit for the ice.

They could angle down later through the gap between FJL and Sv to reach
Bremerhaven which seems likelier than going down the Fram to the bad weather of
the North Atlantic but that means continuing west to the 45th meridian or so.

The Polarstern is proceeding again along its 86º transect in newly graduated
SYI after pausing for 16 hours. The ship is due north of western FJL so could
cut over later today to the gap with Svalbard. Possibly they wish to intersect
their previous drift location with the original floe before heading home.

Bow radar shows a surprising amount of open water consistent with the ice
showing limited sub-100% concentration on AMSR2_AWI. The patches are small
relative to the 3x3 km pixels but still seem to contribute. Smos-SMAP over
OsiSaf shows ice less than 0.5m thick not recently moving much at the PS
location.

Update: they've stopped again at 86.0 35.5 on 20-09-26, must be taking some
samples along  this preferred parallel, interesting concept.

Update: they've stopped again to award themselves another award:

Because the ice is so thin and mechanically weak, the Polarstern is able to
make very good time. The ship needs to stick to its Bremerhaven arrival
schedule of Oct 4th but is thus able to make additional stops at ice stations,
which they are able to schedule along the 86th parallel.

None of the data will be shared, even routine observations like ice thickness
along the long transects, because informing the current melt/freeze season in
nrt has never been a priority. Indeed, disclosure is verboten. Some data types,
like L25 in sea ice diatoms, aren't suitable for sharing as they need to be
measured back at land labs.

In theory, the PS could continue along 86.0 until the Greenwich meridian which
would involve another 2-3 days of travel including brief ice station stops from
their current longitude of 31.5º. Winds are picking up though and possibly
blowing them somewhat south. It's not clear the ship will exit through the Fram
or have time for observations if they do.

Update 1: the ship has turned south under steam, attaining ~33 km in 4 hours
along the 32nd meridian. They could reach Bremerhaven in 4-5 days if they don't
stop at the ice edge for another station.

Update 2: the Polarstern has advanced 111 km south in the last 10 hours to
84.3  32.1 so will be crossing the ice edge into open water in a couple of
hours. Bow radar is already showing large patches of open water as of midnight
on the 26th. The weather is unfavorable for a final ice station given the 14m/s
wind, cold, precip and low light conditions so this is effectively the end of
the Mosaic expedition (except for working up the data into publications).

Update 3: they have stopped right at the ice edge for 5-6 hours, 20-09-28 at
01:00, 4th image.


The ice photo is apparently from Thursday, Sept 24th. The melt ponds are frozen
over enough to stand on but do not have a coat of snow. Bootprints can be seen
in 5cm snow that seems mushy. Bow radar caught ice motion at one of the ice
stations.

It's worth pondering whether a future expedition could make complete loops at
fixed latitude in August, say at 85-87º. This might require a dedicated
contract icebreaker for the CAB portions with the Polarstern following close
behind to spare fuel. What though would be the scientific rationale for doing
constant latitudinal circuits?

The top-of-cloud insolation would be held constant though it would vary down on
the ice, along with air temperature. The coriolis effect would also be constant
in magnitude but then it varies very little at high latitudes (it goes as the
sine of latidude; the sine function barely budges at large angles). Wind
patterns and origins would vary greatly. On the whole, it does not seem holding
one variable constant really helps isolate the others for study.

This is quite creative use of the last week before heading for port, in some
ways more interesting than just studying a single possibly unrepresentative
floe. The Polarstern can do CTD casts, ice thickness, and water temperature
while on the move.

With periodic stops on the the 86º transect, the various teams can go out and
take cores, water samples and weather parameters in the boundary layer and
above. The new twist is going back and forth across the marginal ice zone (ice
edge) to study conditions allowing new ice formation (which as usual takes
place laterally along the periphery of the existing ice side.

The "position buoys" that coordinate with the Polar5/6 overflight campaign
haven't been mentioned before. Normally, the teams out on the ice try to
coordinate with the time of the overflight but that could not happen this year
as access to the base airport in Svalbard only became available at the last
moment (because of virus).

Update 1: 81.6  11.6 20-09-29 14:00  14m/s -2.9ºC. The ship has left the ice
edge for good and is heading down the Fram to study the position buoy floes
before heading to the destination fjord in Svalbard. FOMO is showing engine
room pictures again. The wind up the Strait is strong but there is no ice above
it to be imported.

Update 1: 81.7 1.6 20-09-30  09:00 12m/s -5.7ºC. The PS is in the middle of the
Fram west of Svalbard doing another 24 hour constant-latitude transect to
synergize with Polar 5/6 flights earlier this month. Winds are still blowing
north at near gale force..

By AWIPEV, they mean the joint German-French portion of the large research
station at Ny-Ålesund, Alfred Wegener and Institute Paul Emile Victor (a
Greenland explorer). Some eleven countries do field and lab work there on the
ocean, ice tundra, glaciers, troposphere, stratosphere, magnetosphere where
there is a benefit (or necessity) to be so far north at 79º.  It's not clear
what's involved with Mosaic to 'exchange material" with AWIPEV.

The links below describe some of the research going on. One study is looking
how to protect GPS accuracy at high latitude from ionosphere disturbance.

Some interesting detail has emerged about the Polar5/6 flights out of Svalbard
that could have been a major component of Mosaic had they been fully executable
as initially planned.

The idea with these Arctic-adapted planes which can fly as low as 100m is to
close the resolution gap between detailed but very costly ground exploration
and large-scale remote sensing from satellites (whose view is often obscured by
cloud tops).

The MACS camera mounted underneath Polar 6 is an amazing device that captures
high resolution ice detail simultaneously in the visible, near infrared and
thermal infrared. Some 300,000 images at a frame rate of four per second have
been taken in the first flights, meaning serious AI is necessary for processing
and interpretation.

The camera was developed and operated by DLR (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und
Raumfahrt) which is similar to NASA and a separate organization from AWI/
Helmholtz but participating in Mosaic.

DLR provides a single example on their web page for 84ºN 6ºE in September;
there is no link to an archive. This would be truly massive given the number of
scenes at the ground resolutions mentioned. No serious description of scene or
camera specs is given. A DLR image on twitter has dimension 4096 x 2722 pixels.

https://www.dlr.de/content/en/articles/news/2020/03/
20200915_studying-ice-at-the-centimetre-scale.html

The visible is said to measure roughness of the ice and snow; elsewhere this
unit has been run as stereo triples which could map pressure ridges but here
seems to rely on low angle sun shadows. The near-infrared images provide
automatic discrimination of water from floe at 2 cm resolution; the thermal
infrared images show temperature differences between ice and freezing fissures
at 40 cm.

The conventional thermal palette does not seem optimal for interpretation as a
glasbey palette more clearly shows geometric rim features of some of the melt
ponds.

Meanwhile, Polar 5 is outfitted quite differently to do cloud and atmospheric
research such as determine droplet size distribution, analyze ice crystal
shapes, ice and liquid water content of mixed phase clouds and factors relevant
to cloud formation. Again the route follows the Polarstern ice station route to
synergize with field data. No sample data is available.

The Polarstern seems to be moored in a Svalbard fjord for the exchange of
material (ice cores?) with the AWIPEV lab in Ny-Ålesund. No purpose would be
served by following the expedition back to Bremerhaven.

Nothing new emerged looking today for published expedition research at The
Cryosphere preprints and Google Scholar (for 'Mosaic Arctic'). Articles will be
dribbling in for 3-4 years, thus not terribly helpful for nrt understanding of
2019-20.

It is possible that some areas of the big central database will open earlier
than 2023 or at least be discussed on Meereis forums or insider twitter
accounts.

Three new blogs have appeared on the ticker site:
https://www.meereisportal.de/en/mosaic/sea-ice-ticker/

'Non-Sentinel-1AB high-resolution satellite SAR images had to be ordered two
days in advance with precise lat lon information for floe 2.0. To provide that
information, drift forecasts relied on the Sea Ice Drift Forecast Experiment
SIDFEx  [[despite its total failure in predicting the very rapid TPD drift last
spring that ruined the Mosaic program design] That did ok on a 7-day spaghetti
forecast for 19 – 26 September zonally but missed the meridional as wind
forecasts are only good 3-4 days out.]. For the 120-day forecast, we largely
expect to see a southwest drift that generally follows the Transpolar Drift
Stream [[duh]]".

https://swift.dkrz.de/v1/dkrz_0262ea1f00e34439850f3f1d71817205/SIDFEx_Graphical
/SIDFEx_Polarstern_Graphical_floe2_latest.pdf

"On 21 August the MOSAiC Team set up a new Ice Camp for the fifth leg of the
expedition at ca. 87° 43’ N and 104° 30’ E. On 20 September we then left (were
forced to leave) the second floe. Here, too, a network of autonomous buoys,
smaller than the first, was deployed on the main floe and in its vicinity, and
was once again left behind. 

On the central floe, the Sea Ice Team deployed three sets of buoys, outfitted
with complex systems for observing various parameters: in Met City there are
snow and ice buoys, as well as a buoy for monitoring flows and turbulences,
from the ocean to the atmosphere. A second station, set up on level ice,
focuses on energy flows and optical properties, as well as the mass balance for
snow and sea ice.

We also installed buoys in the pressure ridge near the ship’s bow, which are
above all used to compare the distribution of snow there to the distribution on
level ice. There are also three cameras among the buoys, which offer us a daily
record of the conditions on site. [[no links provided to cam archive]]

Beyond the main floe, 28 buoys were installed on smaller individual floes: 20
in its immediate vicinity (up to 10 km away) and the remainder as far as 40 km
away. One of the buoys was deployed at the North Pole itself, and another near
the sea-ice edge."

Extent on 31 August was 4.19 million km² and had declined by ca. 1.85 million
km² – an area roughly the size of about 5 times the size of Germany. In the
second half of August and until mid of September, a strong ice retreat was
observed in the Canadian Basin, which led so far to the lowest ice extent of
3.784 million km² on 09 September this summer.

Meteorological conditions in July and August included a distinct temperature
anomaly over the Central Arctic producing fluctuations in air temperatures at
925 hPa (~760 m; note they make no use of DMI 80 or its 2m temperatures) of
more than 6°C above the long-term average for the years 1981 to 2010 notably in
July, when the high-pressure cell was directly over Siberia. A detailed
assessment of this year's sea ice minimum is given here:

What becomes of all these thousands of weather balloons? They burst in the
upper atmosphere after two hours of reporting and fall to earth with their
instrument package, usually far from the launch site and unrecoverable.

Some latex ones are said biodegradable but that seems highly implausible at
Arctic temperatures; many would just sink to the ocean bottom along with their
ewaste. A staggering number are released each year by various countries, 22,630
in 2018 just from Canada. Birthday balloons are coated mylar (not
biodegradable) and found everywhere in parks, deserts and wilderness of the US.

And thx to Uniquorn for getting this forum off the ground and contributing so
much to buoy and other visualizations!

The wartime secrecy surrounding mundane data such as ship location, ice
thickness, experimental layout, timestamps on photos, weather balloons etc etc
was astonishing -- who was the enemy?

Not our melt and freeze forums. The enemy was the rest of the scientific
community who might, most implausibly, steal data and publish first or worse,
publish better. Wars always bring civilian casualties -- here the collateral
damage was to public understanding of climate change.

They missed a great opportunity at the north pole, dropping memorializing trash
and passing out souvenir water instead of doing scientific work, then rushing
on for a short stay at a meaningless secondary floe. This year's ice mobility
and melt ponds were especially auspicious for reaching the public, that didn't
happen.

The public paid for the entirety of this expedition (includes $25 million from
US public). If these scientists wish to do private science, let them pay for it
out of their own pocket. In terms of ducking responsibility for public
understanding of climate change (stale papers published in 2023 have zero
impact), silence from scientists simply does not work.

Mosaic floated the preposterous notion that policy makers will read these 2023
papers and make the needed inferences about climate change abatement. Mosaic is
an extreme version of controversy avoidance and seeking the least drama -- the
scientists involved are fully aware it's already too late for the Arctic.

AWI is not an educational institution; even though everyone on staff lists
themselves as professor, there are no students. Outreach was self-promotional
and mis-directed, not overseen by anyone with a scientific background and often
wrong.

Anything that went amiss -- and inevitably a lot did given the unexpected drift
and floe shifts -- was strictly sanitized to present an unrelenting smiley face
to the world. Information did emerge but was scattered all over Twitter and
institutional blogs with no central directory.

I've attached their final weather summary. Like all graphics to date, it's done
ineptly (eg scaling, wind rose, summary stats). The data going into is attached
as a text file if someone wants to work on it. The source web page could
disappear with the end of the expedition; the data will be retained but as a
deep dive into archival petabytes.

    Lead openings and deformation caused by the wind shear are rather abrupt

Thanks, Uniquorn and A-Team for all the images that you were able to pull out
of this award winning expedition.

Update: they've stopped again to award themselves another award:

To those of us who have worked to communicate the science and stories of the
climate crisis to the public, this mission was bitterly disappointing, but that
was never the goal or even a concern. They did what they intended to do and are
proud of it.

Congratulations for all that helped in this thread with data and opinions.
Specially uniquorn and A-team (because these are the ones I remember the most).
I read most of the posts over the last year, and it was great to know the
insides and outs of this expedition thanks to you guys.
Everyone is going to try and make sense of the generated data, most amiss
conclusions will be contaminated with fear.
