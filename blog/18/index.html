<!-- SUMMARY IN ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE -->

<div lang="pt" class="p-summary">
<p>É fácil demais usar o comando <code>`rm -r *`</code> e destruir
todos os seus arquivos importantes. Aqui relato mais um episódio de
desventuras com esse comando!</p>
</div>

<br>
<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->

<p>This is not the first time I removed a lot of important files
with the command <code>`rm -r *`</code>.</p>

<p>Alone, the rm command does not remove recursively by defaults
and may even throw some errors because of not using the
<code>-f</code> flag and mixing directories with regular files.
However, do notice that <em>apparently</em> innocent shell star
glob <code>*</code>. I am not sure if that was z-shell option
<code>RM_STAR_WAIT</code> or the rm command itself, but a warning
dialog was thrown asking if I <q>wished to remove 25 files?</q>, to
which I hit <em>Enter</em>, even though I knew 25 files was not the
right sum of number of files.. If I had only noticed I was at the
wrong directory..</p>

<p><strong>A glob</strong> is a filename generator within the shell
and it will be substituted by all file names matching it. The glob
is not recursive by defaults, either, but in combination with the
<code>-r</code> flag of the rm command that can cause havoc and a
lot of time lost at the very least.</p>

<hr>

<p>To put the story into context, I updated Arch Linux after almost
two months without sync'ing. As I synchonise that once a month and
last month <a href=
"https://www.archlinux.org/news/nvidia-45528-is-incompatible-with-linux-59/">
there was news</a> the just-released Linux 5.9 was not yet
compatible with nvidia driver 455.38, I postponed the sync'ing to
the following month, which is precisely <em>this</em> month.</p>

<p>With the release of nvidia 455.45 last week, today, I decided to
do a first sync with the majority of new packages from a fast Arch
Linux mirror in my country. I planned to sync again later with
<a href="https://archive.archlinux.org/repos/month/">Arch Linux
Archive's monthly repo</a> (copy of the 1<sup>st</sup> of each
month), and use that for the following month or so again, and so
on.</p>

<p>While in a Linux TTY with Tmux and <code>pacman -Syu</code>
running, I decided to go back in Tmux buffer and copy some warning
messages. I messed the keypresses and pasted a lot of text while
pacman was running <strong>post-install hooks</strong>..</p>

<p>That is important to mention I did play with the
<code>/boot</code> directory (which is in a different partition
from <code>/</code>) in my main SSD drive last week while my laptop
hardware was at the computer shop for repairing the display hinge
mechanism..</p>

<p>I cannot be sure what exactly went wrong with the pacman sync
this time but following a reboot systemD printed warnings it could
not find a kernel module for <em>vfat</em> and thus would not mount
<code>/boot</code>, which is a separate partition.</p>

<p>I thought about following <a href=
"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide">Arch
Linux Install Guide</a> and remaking the <code>/boot</code>
partition completely, plus I had a backup of its contents of before
and after the pacman update, so I thought I would give it a
try.</p>

<p>At about the time I had chrooted into my SSD drive with Arch
Linux live media, an unrelated repair man who needed finish a job
with the house gate from yesterday arrived. I lost a little of
concentration at that point.</p>

<p>Plus, mum came to me asking some questions just before I was to
remove old <code>/boot</code> files.. I at <code>/boot</code> using
vifm before I quit it, and then instead of being at
<code>/boot</code>, $PWD was still at <code>/</code>. I am used to
automatically changing to the last directory vifm was because of a
vifm configuration which did not work when I was chrooted! I did
not notice that. I then run <code>`rm -r`</code> with the star glob
and pressed <em>Enter</em> <em>twice</em>.</p>

<p>I only noticed the catastroph when <code>rm</code> was issuing
warnings it could not remove <code>/proc/<em>something</em></code>,
to which I immediately responded with <em>Ctrl+C</em>.
Interestingly, <code>rm</code> did not remove <code>/bin</code> and
other non-system directories from <code>/</code>, however it did
remove <code>/home</code> before other directories! Yay! =.[</p>

<p>Luckily, I have got backups. However the newest backup seems to
be 3 months old. I pushed/forgot to make my last 2 monthly backups,
usually made before Arch Linux updates. I have got most of my files
and system configs backed up. My scripts, dotfiles and website are
up-to-date with GitHub because I sync with that so often.. I did
not move much crypto recently and I have got paper backups of that,
so that is really fortunate. There are only about 4 files I really
lost, some of which are my updated curriculum vitae from last week,
and other documents I may rewrite. Other than those, I think I will
lose mostly <em>time</em>.</p>

<h2>Won't I <em>ever</em> learn?</h2>

<p>Obviously I cannot blame nobody except myself for such noob and
silly mistakes.. This is not the first time, and that is the second
time this year already!</p>

<p>I reckon I am distracted and indisciplined and can improve on
these with some effort which I am willing to make. Habits..</p>

<p>This is not the first time I mess up with <code>rm</code>. This
is the second occasion I did a mistake just after someone draws my
attention, but also on at least two other occasions there was
nobody to distract me.</p>

<p>I'm writing this from a backup laptop with Manjaro which has got
a complete local copy of official repositories and has not been
updated over 10 months! 10 months of no headaches!</p>

<p>I don't like Arch Linux moderators as they are sort of a piece
of shit. However, not all of them are naughty (I suspect the
younger ones are more cruel), and I don't partake guilt in those
terrible Arch Forums anymore. Independent as can be from them!</p>

<p>I have been thinking about installing OpenBSD when Arch Linux
became unbearable, but hopping distros right now would demand a lot
of time there is use for better things at this moment in my life.
So, unfortunately, I am just reinstalling Arch again.</p>

<p>I <em>did cheat</em> a little. GPT table and partitions were
reused. I formatted all partitions again with GParted from a
Xubuntu 18.04 live media.</p>

<h2>Partition scheme</h2>

<ol>
<li>sda1 - <code>/efi</code> Bootloader</li>

<li>sda2 - Linux swap</li>

<li>sda3 - <code>/</code> System root</li>

<li>sda4 - <code>/home</code> User directory</li>
</ol>

<h2>Back with the formatted computer</h2>

<p>This will become a chronology! Back to using my main laptop
(driver). Arch Linux reinstall was not too hard. I had to chroot
twice to properly install networking tools. Download of packages
was slow as heck. I discovered that the laptop ethernet port is
bad. Pacman downlaod speed was ~80 Kbps. I tried changing mirror
servers before discovering the ethernet port was to blame..</p>

<p>Once internet was set up properly, configuring Arch went well
and quickly. I should remark it was necessary to configure the
following with some special care:</p>

<ul>
<li>choosing fast mirror servers (may use either <code>ping</code>
or <code><a href=
"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/reflector">reflector</a></code>)</li>

<li>add EFI entry to motherboard NVRAM to boot new system</li>

<li>configure <code>GRUB</code> such as:<code>GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true
;GRUB_DEFAULT=saved ;GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="loglevel=3
sysrq_always_enabled=true"</code>; Linux has now <a href=
"https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-5.9-Drops-Soft-Scrollback">
dropped support for the scrollback buffer</a> since 5.9</li>

<li>add users to correct groups (sys, log, games, bumblebee,
rfkill, wheel, adm)</li>

<li><code>networkmanager</code> with systemd</li>

<li><code>bumblebee</code> with systemd</li>

<li><code>tlp</code> with systemd</li>

<li><code>timedatectl set-ntp true</code> for time sync</li>

<li><code>localectl set-x11-keymap br abnt2</code>
</li>

<li>install <code>yay</code></li>

<li>enable bitmap fonts <code>cd /etc/fonts/conf.d ;ln -s
../conf.avail/70-yes-bitmaps.conf</code></li>

<li>install xos-terminus and run update font cache
<code>fc-cache</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="basesys">Basic system</h2>

<p>I am making a list with packages to have installed. The list
contains some package groups such as <code><b>base</b></code>,
<code><b>base-devel</b></code>, <code><b>xfce4</b></code>,
<code><b>xfce4-goodies</b></code>, <code><b>xorg</b></code> and
<code><b>xorg-apps</b></code> (beware of <code>xorg-drivers</code>,
only install what is/<a href=
"https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/5nwmql/dont_have_xf86videointelmesa_installed_should_i/">if
really needed</a>).</p>

<p>Other packages are required by my current hardware
(Intel+NVIDIA).</p>

<p>Most packages enable me with basic functionality for dealing
with a lot of file types. For example, for <b>viewing PDF
files</b>, I have got <code><b>xreader</b></code>,
<code><b>xpdf</b></code>, <code><b>gv</b></code>,
<code><b>pdfgrep</b></code> and <code><b>fbgs</b></code> (from
<code>fbida</code> package collection), whereas <a title=
"Arch wiki on various pdf viewers and tools for multiple purposes"
href=
"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PDF,_PS_and_DjVu#PostScript_tools">
other PDF tools</a> I have also got
<code><b>pdfarranger</b></code>, <code><b>pdfmixtool</b></code>,
<code><b>pdftricks</b></code>, <code><b>pdfmod</b></code>,
<code><b>poppler</b></code>, <code><b>pstotext</b></code> and
<code><b>gs</b></code>.</p>

<p>If a package is required by another package, it is <em>probably
not</em> in the list, unless it means something to me..</p>

<p>I can confirm losing some more <em>important</em> files from
within the last 3 months without a backup.. Hopefully I will be
able to restore the missing information and files but that will
take all day long tomorrow.</p>

<hr>

<h3>One day later..</h3>

<p>About 21 hours after accidentaly removing all my important
files, I have got a round-working Arch Linux system and restored
most of my files. Nothing <em>really important</em> was lost.</p>

<p>That was a breeze to reinstall Arch Linux. I will need updating
my backup script because <code>pacman</code> lists did not contain
all packages from my older system..</p>

<h2>Other times I misused `rm`</h2>

<ul>
<li>In 2019 I used <code>rm</code> when cleaning up some old
backups and removed a unique backup copy of documents and photos
from about 2005. I had more backups of that in two other old HDDs,
however I lent both HDDs to my cousin to use with her laptop and
both of them wore out, one after the other! I was not able to
recover files from them. Lessons: three backups may not be enough.
Do not lend media that holds important stuff to you.</li>

<li>Just a few months back, I run <code>rm</code> at my user
directory and lost all personal files. There was a recent backup
but I had to rewrite some important documents that needed to be
up-to-date. Lesson: always be sure about your glob.</li>
</ul>

<p>In recollection, twice I was using <code>vifm</code> (a <a href=
"https://vifm.info/">command line file manager</a>) with a hack to
automatically changing to its last directory on exit. I am
modifying that hack for something safer and that will not let me
get used to changing directories automatically when exiting
<code>vifm</code>.</p>

<pre><code># ~/.bashrc

#vifm
#record working directory leaving Vifm
vf()
{
        command vifm --choose-dir - "$@" &gt;~/.config/vifm/vifmcd.txt
}
vfcd()
{
        cd "$( &lt;~/.config/vifm/vifmcd.txt )"
}
#https://wiki.vifm.info/index.php?title=How_to_set_shell_working_directory_after_leaving_Vifm</code></pre>

<br>

<p><strong>UNIX users ought to think before running a
command.</strong>
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Fifty-one days later (2021 jan)..</h3>

<p>I did it again.. I was testing a script at a dedicated temp
directory. I opened many terminal windows at once and was doing too
many tests quickly. I opened another terminal window and forgot it
was not at the temp directory.</p>

<p>I run <code>rm *.txt~*archInstall*</code> and removed 7 files
from <code>$HOME</code> (I was messing with <a href=
"../../repo/scripts/archPkgCrossCheck.sh">this script</a>)..
Fortunately, it only removed some of the <em>.txt</em> files, which
I was able to recover all except one and maybe another one may be
outdated a little from my last backup in December.</p>

<p>I have been trying to follow a tip from <a href=
"https://aurelio.net/">Aurelio Jargas</a> that is to try and always
use a glob that <em>more than</em> just <code>*</code>..</p>
