<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, <em>Soundcloud</em> does not fetch episodes from
my custom XML feed so I am not available there..</p>

<p>The scripts to generate my blog pages, sitemaps and rss feeds
are rather complex at this point. I do not intend to update them
very much more, rather I want to stabilise them so I can add
content easily later. All processing is done using shell scripting
and some blobs written in C, such as <code><a href=
"https://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/">tidy</a></code>,
<code><a href=
"http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/">xmlstarlet</a></code> and
<code><a href="http://xmlsoft.org/xmllint.html">xmllint</a></code>.
The scripts take about 40 seconds to process all pages of my blog.
In order to make the scripts run a little faster, I could
optionally keep cached files for pre-processed content which did
not change.</p>

<h2>Making-Of</h2>

<p>After recording the podcast from a high cliff on the outskirts
of my city and contemplating such beautiful country scenery, I
reviewed the podcast recording and then watched some YouTube
videos..</p>

<p>When I finally decided to head back home and turned the engine
key, the battery was dead.</p>

<p>Mum's car has got an automatic start, therefore I cannot simply
pop the clutch to get it rolling.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the car has got insurance. I phoned up the
insurance service and asked for an engine start help. They said it
would take 75min for the help to reach me.</p>

<p>I waited patiently at the car watching some YouTube films. I
tried to start the engine a few times without success.</p>

<p>The car has a terrible software system. A list of bad
programming of this car model software is due. For example, when I
turn the keys, the radio goes on at the same time as all the lights
of the panel alongside the engine spark firing! Also, if I open and
then close the car door, the radio and all the panel lights will
light up for a moment like an init system is booting up.</p>

<p>If battery is low, the <a href=
"https://www.chevrolet.com.br/carros/novo-onix">ONIX-model car</a>
software does not route energy preferentially for the engine to
start.</p>

<p>The insurance guy arose but we had a problem with the address I
had given the insurance lady on the phone previously, so I had to
update it by phone.</p>

<p>The new phone attendant was very talkative and demanded
confirmation of a lot of information and needed to talk to the
insurance guy who was already standing besides me.</p>

<p>The insurance woman on the phone was so suspicious and cautious
that she took a long time. In the meantime, raining came.</p>

<p>Raining got very strong, the insurance man got into his car and
I got into mine but all windows were open.</p>

<p>Finally, the insurance guy gave up talking to the insurance lady
on the phone and got wet into the rain trying to charge my car
battery.</p>

<p>I was able to pull up the windows but a lot of water got into
the car..</p>
