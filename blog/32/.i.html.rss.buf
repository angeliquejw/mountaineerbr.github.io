<p>Levei meu pai para tomar a primeira dose de vacina na minha cidade. Tamb√©m pegamos uma bula da vacina, a Coronavac do Butantan.</p>

<p>Finally, the age group of my father was eligible to take a vaccine shot against Covid. Here in Brazil, most vaccines are from <a hreflang="pt" href="https://butantan.gov.br/instituto-butantan">Butantan Institute</a>. This is a good vaccine, not so powerful as Pfizer&#39;s and others but should be the safest of all. This vaccine is made with old and fully-tested technology.</p>
<p>Father was rather anxious about this shot. He doesn&#39;t really live in the same town as I do but vaccines for his age group got here earlier so we arranged for him to get his shot here.</p>
<p>That was a fun day. We were just a little worried he would be unable to get the shot but all went well.</p>
<p>Father asked the nurse for a medicine leaflet of then Coronavac vaccine and she gave it to him. I took a photo of it.</p>
