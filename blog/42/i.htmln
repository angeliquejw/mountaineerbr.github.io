<!-- SUMMARY IN ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE -->
<div lang="pt" class="p-summary"><p>Notas sobre o último episódio
da temporada do podcast. Não conseguimos abordar todos os assuntos,
mas tem bastante conteúdo e histórias..</p></div><br>


<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->
<p>I am not sure how to script out this podcast, but I sure want to record
one more episode.

</p>
<p>Actually, I did try recording a last episode for this podcast season,
but I decided to try to broadcast a live event on YouTube
with Streamlabs (Android) and lost the stream (about 36min) because
Streamlabs was not able to stream to YouTube. Didn't warn it in a way I could
understand before ending the event.</p>


<p></p>
<dl>
	<dt>Sync news about YouTube channel (removed) and
	this website future developments (or lack of)</dt>
	<dd>Just go over the subjects on blog posts
	<a href="../38/">#38</a> and <a href="../39/">#39</a>.</dd>

	<dt>Plans for a future Season 1 of my podcast.</dt>
	<dd>The second season (Season 1) of the podcast may
	be in English. If so, episodes will be shorter and
	I will need planning a little more for each episode
	as I fear my spoken English may be rather rusty..</dd>
	
	<dt>Getting my parents vaccinated and Covid</dt>
	<dd>Dad vaccination went OK but mum was not able to have
	ser second shot, yet. We met some funny people while waiting
	on queues..</dd>

	<dt>Politics, public contests and jobs</dt>
	<dd>Cannot really say there is a <em>complete</em> lack of jobs
	but that is not a simple subject.. Some political notes.</dd>
	
	<dt>Bitcoin price, Elon Musk and Hodling</dt>
	<dd>Just to make sure I think Elon Musk is not making such
	good decisions anymore.. Comments about hodling.</dd>
	
	<dt>Climate Summit</dt>
	<dd>USA is back, promises to cut emissions by 50% until 2050.
	Leader, some other countries try to follow suit.
	Bill Gates is an arse.
	<br>
	I wish these powerful people, not intelligent people,
	would talk about vanquishing hunger, illness and poverty.
	As it is, that summit is ridiculous.

	<em>Unfortunately, this topic was not covered in this episode..</em>
	</dd>
	

	<dt>Becoming an activist by accident, Clintel and Heartland</dt>
	<dd>There may some powerful people looking for me.
	They want to <a href="https://www.wcel.org/sites/default/files/publications/The%20West%20Coast%20Environmental%20Law%20SLAPP%20Handbook.pdf">SLAPP</a>.<br>
	<em>Unfortunately, this topic was not covered in this episode..</em>
	</dd>

	<dt>Defeating my vices</dt>
	<dd>I am glad I don't do hard drugs, such as cocaine. But alcohol,
	tobacco and Marijuana may also become a big problem,
	specially when these vices lock together.<br>
	There are some YouTube references which are helping me a lot:<br>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CaptainGnarkill/videos?app=desktop">Captain Gnarkill</a><br>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/KyleSullivan-after-booze/videos">Kyle Sullivan</a><br>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TimothyWard/videos">Timothy Ward</a><br>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/travisdwoo/videos">Travis Woo</a><br>
	<a hreflang="pt" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RafaelJord%C3%A3o/videos">Rafael Jordão</a><br>
	<a hreflang="pt" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DaviSilvaCoachAddiction/videos">Davi Silva Coach Addiction</a><br>
	This last one channel (Davi's) is helping me a lot because he has got
	new techniques to help defeat addictions. For example, he says
	we should not keep thinking alcoholism is a disease and that
	we shall be ill of it for ever. Such thoughts just make us depressed.
	Better not to think too much of our own addiction and try to
	keep on the recovery path. Also, better not to keep talking
	too much about addiction.
	We want to be free of addictions and forget to talk about it.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>Mushrooms and Psychedelics</dt>
	<dd>Talk about mushroom trip stories from some years back and <em>maybe</em>
	we should aim to have another mushroom trip <em>some time</em>.
	But before that, we need the appropriate <em>date, set and setting</em>.
	</dd>
