<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->
<p>
I don't think any clone of <code>ksh</code> can beat the original in term of speed
because Korn's C code cannot be beat.
</p>

<p>Feature-wise, <code>mksh</code> wants to be compatible with <code>bash</code> and
<code>oksh</code> is a little more true to <code>ksh</code> however it has gone
a different path and has got less features than <code>ksh</code>.
But I haven't read nor used near enough about these yet to have
any due criticism..</p>

<p><code>ksh</code> code is also dependent on other software from
<a href="https://github.com/att/ast/">Advanced Software Technology</a> suite,
developed by Mr Korn and a few others through many decades
of work.
</p>

<p>When Siteshwar and Kurtis Rader started to work on <code>ksh</code> code
in 2017 thereabouts, they
<a title="Squeezing Water from Stone - KornShell in 2019" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J20eGwGCwU">could not understand it very well</a>
and chose to remove large chunks of the code
and rewrite whatever was left
in such a C idiomatics and using compilers that made the shell
terribly slow compared to original stable <code>ksh93u+</code>
and ultimately led to the AST code reversion.</p>



<p>In retrospective, if Siteshwar and kdrader1961 wanted to change so
much of the code, they should have <strong>forked</strong>
<em><code>ksh</code> repo</em> in the first place</p>

<p>I am happy some stepped up and manage to get AST (and <code>ksh93</code>)
official repo back on the correct track.</p>


<p><code>ksh</code> seems like a suitable default shell for scripting.
Feature-wise, that is comparable to <code>bash+zsh</code> in some sense.
Even though Mr Korn, Mr Glenn and others stopped developing
AST tools, I reckon these tools can be useful for quite some time
yet almost unrivalled..</p>

<p>For example, instead of using GNU or <code>busybox</code>
default utilities such as <code>grep</code>,
one can use AST <code>grep</code>, <code>wc</code> and so on..</p>

<p>AST repo was easy to compile in my machine and <code>ksh93</code> had many
features enabled by defaults. I wonder why Siteshwar
decided to change the compiler if this works so well in my
current machine and, as I have read,
in so many legacy hardware architectures, too.</p>

<p>I will be using <code>ksh</code> for scripting more often.
There are some specific cases <code>ksh</code> beats <code>zsh</code> and <code>bash</code> by a lot,
in other cases just by little. Still, it does not let the
user expectations down as it seems to always be faster
than these other big shells.</p>

<p>In fact, I rewrote
a <code>bash</code> <a href="../repo/scripts/bitcoin.tx.sh">bitcoin parser script</a> in <code>ksh</code>.
Unfortunately, in this case, as the script is so big, convoluted
and makes heavy use of external tools
(mainly <code>bitcoin-cli</code> and <code>jq</code>),
it cannot be get much faster..
Still I got a 10-15% speed increase and
sometimes more than that depending on the functions used.
However, if you are going to use that script parser,
prefer the <code>bash</code> version as the <code>ksh</code> code is experimental and not
fully tested to match <code>bash</code> output..
</p>

<p>Below are some references I spent almost a full day reading.
They are related to <code>ksh</code> more recent developments and some other
references from a live event I made recently on YouTube..</p>
