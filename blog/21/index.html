<!-- SUMMARY IN ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE -->

<div lang="pt" class="p-summary">
<p>Uma lista e uma análise sobre as metas conquistadas (sem querer)
depois do mestrado e planos futuros.</p>
</div>

<br>
<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->

<p>I used to write end-of-year lists of what goals I met and the
ones I would pursue in the following year. It has been a long time
I have not written one of those.</p>

<p>After completing master's course from university in 2017, I was
completely lost. Since about 2006, when I was in high school in
Japan, I decided I wanted to graduate in biological sciences and in
a master's programme. I would then go back to Japan visit my
friends within 7 or 8 years. Graduation took longer than expected
and at one point I even thought I would not make it. Master's
course went well, did not take longer than expected but I am not
able to go back to Japan <em>for a visit</em>.</p>

<p>For a long time I run after these goals and never thought about
what I would do once I had reached them. I would <em>like</em> and
enjoy it very much to go back to Japan for a visit but I reckon I
need earn some good money first as I am getting older.</p>

<p>Other than a generic goal of getting a job with a signed work
card <span lang="pt"><em>(carteira de trabalho
assinada)</em></span>, I have not got big dreams or expectations
anymore. You see, I went to Japan when I was young with my own
efforts to plan the whole trip, so I feel no need to travel the
world anymore. Instead, I learnt to like my country more and I wish
to stay close to my family, that is all I want right now.</p>

<p>So while I have not got bigger plans, I wish to write some stuff
down as an exercise. Maybe I can have a better idea and bigger
goals later on.</p>

<h2>Goals reached after Master's graduation (unplanned)</h2>

<ol>
<li>Installed Arch Linux</li>

<li>Learned Shell scripting, Bash and Z-Shell</li>

<li>Put my paws on financial markets</li>

<li>Learned money management</li>

<li>Made some good investments</li>
</ol>

<h2>Goals for 2021</h2>

<ul>
<li>Not get infected with Covid virus</li>

<li>Catch up with Brazilian environmental law</li>

<li>Apply for public examinations and get successively better
marks</li>

<li>Become a runner or at least do physical exercise routinely</li>

<li>Quit smoking tobacco</li>

<li>Quit drinking beer</li>

<li>Marijuana only occasionally</li>

<li>Lose 5-8 kilos</li>

<li>Enjoy mum and dad more</li>

<li>Do good money management</li>

<li>Be more patient and polite with people in general (<a href=
"https://www.nytimes.com/guides/year-of-living-better/how-to-be-more-empathetic"><em>empathy</em>
training</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>A quote from <a href=
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op0-u9-S4B0">Ugly Old Goat</a>
video:</p>

<blockquote>I am fast, I work hard, I party hard and I drink hard.
<br>
--Ugly Old Goat</blockquote>

<p>That just means I do things with a lot of passion and effort. I
ought add that I <strong>study hard</strong>, too, and that I am
trying to give up on bad habits acquired through hardship of
personal problems during university.</p>

<p><strong>I wish all my readers a great 2021! Much Health for
everyone!</strong>
