<!-- SUMMARY IN ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE -->
<div lang="pt" class="p-summary"><p>Com a série <q>Biologia para Cínicos</q>,
espero pode apresentar uma visão mais seca e mais dura da realidade 
da disciplina de ciências, porém mais próxima da relidade
do que muitos livros e instituições ensinam por aí.</p></div><br>


<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->
<p>
There are many illusions about biology.
I understand that is <em>partly</em> so because commoners are
too passionate about Nature. In contrast, professional biologists
ought to be cold and rational about Nature, but not all of them are,
either.
</p>

<p>
Today I saw an ad on TV about protecting wildlife, such as birds
and other animals of the forest. The ad said Nature does not need us
but we (humans) need Nature.
</p>

<p>
Well, I may disagree.
</p>

<p>
We are part of Nature, we are the <em>effect</em>
of climate and other conditions on Earth which allowed human beings
to develop.



There is no reason at all
to think animals (rational or not) in the universe are alike
earthbound ones.
</p>

<p>
Cities and buildings are also natural. I dislike the word <q>natural</q>
because it does not make much sense nor does it make things clearer in a
wider analysis. That word is just an umbrella wording
<a title="What's 'Natural' anyway?" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucn2KzCDnOY">(and misused nowadays)</a> but obviously I understand
commoners will use that in opposition to <em>man-made stuff</em>.
</p>

<p>
Why do commoners want to keep all species and avoid
any and all species going extinct?
That is nonsensical!
New species are emerging all the time (why not?) as well as
many others are going extinct all the time.
</p>

<p>
Who can say an older species is better than a new species?
And what is <em>better</em> in this case, anyways?
Newer species may emerge because environmental conditions changed.
Animals usually have a very specific <em>niche</em> or a house
in the environment. If their house does not provide conditions,
new species will evolve to take that place! There is no vacuum in nature.
</p>

<p>
Not a few times
I have seen reports of sightings of animals long thought to have
gone extinct!
That kind of news is actually much common if you start noticing them..
</p>

<p>
New species may eventually be more fit than older ones.
Thus, the value for the environment of new versus extinct species
may not change at different times (even if environment changes, too).
Also, species of a niche may change by random drift, meaning
older and newer species are equivalent and that is just by
random chance one goes extinct while the other occupies its place.
Is that <em>better</em> means <em>more fit</em>? If so, the better
for the environment means the more fit species.
On the other hand, if <em>better</em> means more useful, humans may
be the best, then.
</p>

<p>
Humans shall prove very useful for maintaining our
natural world. When we move from Earth, someday, we will take
animals, bacteria and viruses with us to new worlds.
In the meantime, humans will strive to keep species which
are useful for them, such as cattle, and will keep the
ecosystem required by them and by ourselves.
</p>

<p>
Human relation with the environment will improve
over time as humans get more comfortable and have got time
to think about other beings. Do not ignore humans fought
natural forces all along to avoid being crushed by them.
Also, at our modern world, most world population
is very very poor and may not even have water or food to keep
their health.
</p>

<p>
Check the
<a title="Curve Ambiental de Kuznets (EKC)" hreflang="en" href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w3914">environmental curve of Kuznets</a>,
which is, unfortunately,  badly interpreted by modern biologists
because they do not seem to understand that
what is pollution for one species is food for others, a cycle.
</p>

<p>
Plants will actually use sulfur and nitrogen from car and factory exhaust!
Phosphorus from smoke can also be used by trees.
See for example
<a title="Atmospheric Pollution and Plant Growth" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/169376a0">(a)</a> or 
<a href="bleasdale1952.pdf">(local copy)</a>,
<a title="Trees eat pollution products" href="https://www.nature.com/news/2008/080818/full/news.2008.1046.html">(b)</a>,
<a title="As acid rain is curtailed, wheat gets less sulfur needed for tasty bread" href="https://www.startribune.com/a-sourdough-tradeoff-as-acid-rain-is-curtailed-wheat-gets-less-sulfur-needed-for-tasty-bread/571971482/">(c)</a>,
<a title="African smoke is fertilizing Amazon rainforest and oceans" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190729151853.htm">(d)</a> and
<a title="Beijing's air pollution helps its trees grow better, faster, stronger, study finds" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2155855/beijings-air-pollution-helps-its-trees-grow-better-faster">(e)</a>.

That is too bold a claim trees <em>clean the air</em>, as
some papers deem, but my point is just trees do use some sulfur, nitrogen
and other elements
from air pollution for their own benefit. Also note some researches
are performed only under laboratory conditions which exacerbate
normal pollution levels by a lot, which conclusions may be off from
what happens in nature.

Carbon is food for photosynthetic organisms as they embody
carbon from the atmosphere into their body to grow. That is basic
plant physiology.

That is
actually quite fascinating if you can reckon life is not under
our control and life is too pungent and cannot be detained on Earth.
</p>


<p>
Carbon is funny. More specifically, its bonds with other chemical
elements give it extreme flexibility at earthly conditions.
I hope to write a little article about how the carbon atom originated
life someday but
I am still appreciating just how funny an element that is..
Carbon is like Lego&reg; pieces and if you can
roll them enough with other elements, they will interact and
nucleate into ever more complex pieces and eventually life forms.
</p>


<p>
If people love life and all species, then they must love the bacteria
and viruses, too. <em>Why not</em>?
I suspect commoners love <strong>some</strong> furry animals
and their love gets weaker the more genetically apart species
are from humans. I cannot blame them!
</p>

<p>
That is plain there are thousands of other planets supporting life
throughout Milk Way. There is no reason to think
life on Earth is better or worse than any other life in the universe.
In my head, generically, they all have got about the same value.
So why humans are
so worried about protecting all species on Earth <strong>but ourselves</strong>?
It does not matter at all in the greater scheme of things..
</p>

<p>
Microorganisms are much more important than animals. The energy flux
of the living start with photosynthetic and chemosynthetic life.
The frog, the bird, the lion.. They are <strong>not</strong> more
important than photosynthetic life so why do commoners want to
protect organisms that matter <em>the least</em> to Earth environment?
The frog, the bird, the lion and humans may get extinct and it will not
matter much or for long to our ecosystems. New species will
promptly take their place as long as the basal energy availability
is intact. Over time, even complex body schemes may evolve from
single cell organisms but more complex or rational life
may not necessarily develop.
