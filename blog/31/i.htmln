<!-- SUMMARY IN ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE -->
<div lang="pt" class="p-summary"><p>Estava um pouco preocupado que
minha brincadeira de configurar uma conexão com a rede do bitcoin
pudesse ter atraído olhares de pares ruins, mas nada disso.</p>

<p>Os problemas de internet que tenho sofrendo há duas semanas
foram finalmente esclarecidos hoje quando um técnico do provedor
de serviço de internet veio até minha casa. Não achou nada anormal
com meu router. Falou que outro vizinho estava com o mesmo problema
e que eles então iriam fazer manutenção em uma central do meu bairro.
Mas os problemas ainda não acabaram..</p></div><br>


<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->
<p>The internet service provider technician came to my home
and checked my local connection and the modem and that was all fine.</p>

<p>
There was a huge problem going on with the neighbourhood internet
for the past <em>two weeks</em> and only today I was let know about that!
</p>

<p>The problemas were a very slow internet connection, specially
bas was the upload transmission, and
<code>ping</code>ing from Linux Shell or even from the router itself
(through the tools page),
showed a 30% or more packet loss!</p>

<p>I was a little worried when the technician asked to use my laptop to test
internet speed and to log in to the router. Maybe he
would start typing <em><a href="https://www.speedtest.net/">speedtest</a></em>
for example, and Firefox
would suggest him naughty websites starting with <em>suck..</em> and alike.
I don't know why these sort of suggestions pop up sometimes but I
told the guy to ignore anything unusual in my computer..</p>

<p>After the guy finished checking the router, he said they would work
on hardware maintenance in my area as another
neighbour client of mine was having similar issues and
noise was detected by another technician guy in one of their
distribution equipment about my neighbourhood.</p>

<p>I was <strong>a little preoccupied</strong> my messing with opening
ports and granting access from bitcoin network had attracted attention
from bad peers but, alas,
that seems to have been just a regular a problem of the internet provider..</p>

<p>The technician did reconfigure my router so now it has got a
new <abbr title="Service Set Identification, wireless networks">SSID</abbr>
and password. The administration login name and its password
to access router settings, such as opening ports, also changed and these
were not given to me and I forgot to ask.
Even though internet speed is nominal now,
I had to schedule another technical visit
for tomorrow.. Hopefully that will be the last for a long time!
</p>

<hr>
<p>On another note, I am messing about with a <a href="https://github.com/john-bokma/tumblelog">tumblelog</a>
from John Bokma. It is really a nice micro blog generator and I am
using it, with modifications, to present a
<a href="../podcast/">stand-alone version of podcast episode index</a>.</p>

<p>There is some work left to be done so I am not yet adding any links
to it from other pages, but eventually there will be more
hints to find it.</p>

<hr>
<p>Finally, internet is super fast and
with the router administrator details in hand port forwarding could be enabled!
