<!-- SUMMARY IN ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE -->

<div lang="pt" class="p-summary">
<p>Estava um pouco preocupado que minha brincadeira de configurar
uma conexão com a rede do bitcoin pudesse ter atraído olhares de
pares ruins, mas nada disso.</p>

<p>Os problemas de internet que tenho sofrendo há duas semanas
foram finalmente esclarecidos hoje quando um técnico do provedor de
serviço de internet veio até minha casa. Não achou nada anormal com
meu router. Falou que outro vizinho estava com o mesmo problema e
que eles então iriam fazer manutenção em uma central do meu bairro.
Mas os problemas ainda não acabaram..</p>
</div>

<br>
<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->

<p>The internet service provider technician came to my home and
checked my local connection and the modem and that was all
fine.</p>

<p>There was a huge problem going on with the neighbourhood
internet for the past <em>two weeks</em> and only today I was let
know about that!</p>

<p>The problemas were a very slow internet connection, specially
bas was the upload transmission, and <code>ping</code>ing from
Linux Shell or even from the router itself (through the tools
page), showed a 30% or more packet loss!</p>

<p>I was a little worried when the technician asked to use my
laptop to test internet speed and to log in to the router. Maybe he
would start typing <em><a href=
"https://www.speedtest.net/">speedtest</a></em> for example, and
Firefox would suggest him naughty websites starting with
<em>suck..</em> and alike. I don't know why these sort of
suggestions pop up sometimes but I told the guy to ignore anything
unusual in my computer..</p>

<p>After the guy finished checking the router, he said they would
work on hardware maintenance in my area as another neighbour client
of mine was having similar issues and noise was detected by another
technician guy in one of their distribution equipment about my
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>I was <strong>a little preoccupied</strong> my messing with
opening ports and granting access from bitcoin network had
attracted attention from bad peers but, alas, that seems to have
been just a regular a problem of the internet provider..</p>

<p>The technician did reconfigure my router so now it has got a new
<abbr title=
"Service Set Identification, wireless networks">SSID</abbr> and
password. The administration login name and its password to access
router settings, such as opening ports, also changed and these were
not given to me and I forgot to ask. Even though internet speed is
nominal now, I had to schedule another technical visit for
tomorrow.. Hopefully that will be the last for a long time!</p>

<hr>

<p>On another note, I am messing about with a <a href=
"https://github.com/john-bokma/tumblelog">tumblelog</a> from John
Bokma. It is really a nice micro blog generator and I am using it,
with modifications, to present a <a href="../podcast/">stand-alone
version of podcast episode index</a>.</p>

<p>There is some work left to be done so I am not yet adding any
links to it from other pages, but eventually there will be more
hints to find it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Finally, internet is super fast and with the router
administrator details in hand port forwarding could be enabled!</p>
