## BITCOIN-CLI WRAPPER AND BITCOIN-RELATED SCRIPTS

These scripts wrap bitcoin-cli (bitcoind) and try to parse data;
they are transaction-centred.

_Make sure bitcoin-dameon is **fully synchonised**_, otherwise some
functions may not work properly!

___Tip___: to use bitcoin.tx.sh, have bitcoind set with
transaction indexes (option 'txindex=1'),
otherwise user must supply block id hash manually and
still some vin transaction information is not going to be retrieved.

Depends on `bitcoin-cli` _RPC_ call output.
That is good as we can be dependable on a set of minimally-parsed data
to start with.

These wrapper scripts require `bash`, `bitcoin-cli` and `jq`.
Some scripts have got [grondilu's bitcoin-bash-tools](https://github.com/grondilu/bitcoin-bash-tools)
functions embedded.

The script `bitcoin.tx.sh`  will deliver better summary data than
&lt;blockchain.com&gt; or &lt;blockchair&gt;. This script can return
addresses from segwit and multisig transactions. The average
time for parsing transactions until block height 667803 is about
2 seconds with my i7, however that depends on the number of
vins and vouts of each transaction. Parsing a few thousand transactions
seems quite feasible for personal use.


SCRIPT NAME | DESCRIPTION
:-------------|:-----------
__bitcoin.blk.sh__ | bitcoin block information and functions
__bitcoin.hx.sh__ | create base58 address types from public key and WIF from private keys (shell function wrapper)
__bitcoin.tx.sh__ |  parse transactions by hash or transaction json data
__bitcoin.tx.ksh__ |  version ported from bash to ast ksh (script version v0.7.29k-); gains about 10-15% speed improvement over bash, experimental
__bitcoin.zzz.parsedTxs.blk638200.txt__ | example of parsed transactions from block 638200
__blockchair.btcoutputs.sh__ |  download blockchair output dump files systematically, see also [this repo](https://github.com/mountaineerbr/bitcoin-all-addresses)

## USAGE EXAMPLES

Tip: if bitcoind is set with transaction indexes (option `txindex=1`),
that is _not_ necessary to supply block id hash with option `-b`.
The following examples are more complicated than normal usage.

_A._ Use bitcoin-cli to make an rpc-call and get transaction hashes from the memory pool; use jq to open the json array with transaction hashes; bitcoin.tx.sh will make further rpc-calls and parse each transaction data asynchronously; at the end, the script sorts buffers and writes a text file at $PWD:

```bash
bitcoin-cli getrawmempool  | jq -r '.[]' | bitcoin.tx.sh
```

_B._ Parse a single transaction; the last two commands should have the same outputs:

```bash
TRANSACTION_HASH=a8bb9571a0667d63eaaaa36f9de87675f0d430e13c916248ded1d13093a77561

BLOCK_HEIGHT=638200

BLOCK_HASH=$( bitcoin-cli getblockhash $BLOCK_HEIGHT )
    
bitcoin.tx.sh -b"$BLOCK_HASH" "$TRANSACTION_HASH"

bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction "$TRANSACTION_HASH" true "$BLOCK_HASH" | bitcoin.tx.sh
```
    
_C._ Parse the first 10 transactions from block height number 400000; no output to screen is written, wait until all transactions are parsed and then concatenated in the correct order; a file containing the resulting parsing is written to $PWD, or use options -o to write output to screen only (check script help page):

```bash
BLOCK_HASH=000000000000000004ec466ce4732fe6f1ed1cddc2ed4b328fff5224276e3f6f
    
bitcoin.blk.sh -ii 400000 | head | bitcoin.tx.sh -b"$BLOCK_HASH"
```
