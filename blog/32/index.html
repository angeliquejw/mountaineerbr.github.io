<!-- SUMMARY IN ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE -->

<div lang="pt" class="p-summary">
<p>Levei meu pai para tomar a primeira dose de vacina na minha
cidade. Também pegamos uma bula da vacina, a Coronavac do
Butantan.</p>
</div>

<br>
<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->

<p>Finally, the age group of my father was eligible to take a
vaccine shot against Covid. Here in Brazil, most vaccines are from
<a hreflang="pt" href=
"https://butantan.gov.br/instituto-butantan">Butantan
Institute</a>. This is a good vaccine, not so powerful as Pfizer's
and others but should be the safest of all. This vaccine is made
with old and fully-tested technology.</p>
<!-- 
**Need checking this info before publishing as it has been a long time
**since I saw detailed information about the most popular vaccines and
**their differences

<p>
?This vaccine uses a chimp adenovirus as the vector or envelope of
the Covid virus RNA chunks.

</p>
-->

<p>Father was rather anxious about this shot. He doesn't really
live in the same town as I do but vaccines for his age group got
here earlier so we arranged for him to get his shot here.</p>

<p>That was a fun day. We were just a little worried he would be
unable to get the shot but all went well.</p>

<p>Father asked the nurse for a medicine leaflet of then Coronavac
vaccine and she gave it to him. I took a photo of it.</p>
