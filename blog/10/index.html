<p>Mr Walter "Blaacky" Schwartz is a USA citizen. The young
American man studied and graduated as a photographic engineer at
the United States Army request and cost. He was trained and refined
his skills to do it right: press the shutter at the perfect timing
and capture the moment of the strike. Although Mr Schwartz
preferred not to reveal what institution he received training, he
carries the name of at least one very famous camera maker company
in his diploma.</p>
<!-- how old was Mr Walter at that year? -->

<p>The first story is about a mission over the eye of a hurricane,
at a very high altitude to be able take photos for a weather
committee of scientists. At the time we talked, he reasoned about
one elegant and simple definition for the purpose of narrow-angle
lenses: it was to go in pursuit of further detail of the subject
when it was not convenient to go closer, of course. Another group
of men could never have passed as near a spiralling rotatory to
death and return home with mission accomplished but those men in
the crew.</p>

<p>On other occasions, Mr Walter entered volcanoes under mission
assignment to <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/">National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</a>.</p>

<p>One of the most admirable trace of character of Mr Walter was
his courage in face of such dangerous situations. While he talked
about those remembrances, we would not quiver his voice. His life
stories are truly fascinating.</p>

<p>Another one of his military stories he could and was willing to
share is as follows.</p>

<p>He was sent to one military missions aboard the Memphis Belle
bomber craft. It was the first heavy bomber to return to the US
after completing 25 successful missions during the Second World War
in Europe. The Memphis Belle is <a title="Memphis Belle Unveiling"
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcRXOdqwxwE">an American
icon</a>, it represents sacrifice and what Americans will do to
protect their freedom.</p>

<p>The mission started upon arrival of the crew members at the War
Front, located somewhere in the coast range of England. The Air
Front was composed of dozens of wings and for this mission, as many
as 35 aircrafts would campaign together. The air front faced France
and Germany, territories which were taken by the enemy at the
Second World War. All crew members were gathered with the group
commander at the target map room. It was where they were informed
the whereabouts and objectives the commission was to carry out for
the first time. All crew members synchronised their wrist watches,
just before the little spare time they had before lift off. The
spirits of them were high, expectant and hopeful. Many soldiers
went to see the base priest for their prayers.</p>

<p>The aircraft he was sent to board was a B-17 heavy bomber craft,
a B-17 made by Boeing and was propelled by four engines. <a title=
"The Fabulous Fortress" href=
"https://www.airforcemag.com/article/0785fortress/">The particular
design</a> made it possible for the aircraft sustain flight even
when severely damaged. <a title=
"World War II aircraft that were shot to hell—and came back" href=
"https://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/unbreakable-42839119/">
It had a big wing</a> which could bear many holes..</p>

<p>It had a nearly frameless clear-view nose, which was transparent
and bore the pilot stick panel, sharing the tight space alongside
one head gunner. Most of the 10-men crew were gunners, positioned
at specific angles to cover most attack angles. Each gunner had a
radius range of 1,000 yards frontward and adding all gunner posts,
they were protected almost 360 degrees. Others would take care of
the bombs to be dropped. There was one chief bomb engineer at the
wing formation who would decide the precise moment of bomb release,
after which every other bomber group crew would release their bomb
load in sequence. The air formation provided them even more
protection at altitude of 25 thousand feet (7.6 kilometres
approximately).</p>

<p>About a week and a half after the crew finished their
25<sup>th</sup> mission, they were visited by the King and Queen on
the 26<sup>th</sup> of May 1943. <a title=
"How did the bomber Memphis Belle get named?" href=
"https://www.thebesttimes.com/entertainment/how-did-the-bomber-memphis-belle-get-named/article_ca28dea6-d6e5-11e7-85d1-c3fbad9577e1.html">
That is thought</a> the pilot, Robert Morgan, named the craft
<q>Memphis Belle</q> for his Memphis sweetheart, Margaret Polk.
<a title="Boeing B-17F Memphis Belle Restoration: Markings & More"
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5_TDxpkuTA">There were other
markings</a>, such as <q>Irene</q> underneath the window of the
radio operator Hanson and the name <q>Virginia</q> on the
right-hand side where the waist gunner position was. The very
well-known nose art was a drawing of 25 bombs, represneting 25
succesful missions, and some stars over the bombs, representing
when the Bell was a lead in the attack formation. There were some
swastikas around the aircraft around mid to late May that year.
Soon after, <a title="26th Mission: War Bond Tour" href=
"https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/Museum-Exhibits/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/1506252/26th-mission-war-bond-tour/">
the aircraft had it's 26<sup>th</sup> mission</a> while still in
the 91<sup>st</sup> Bomb Group. The markings changed over time.</p>

<p>Mr Schwartz said his aircraft was not carrying bombs, his
mission was to take photographs, footage of the mission
execution.</p>

<p>Outside the Memphis Belle, many black specks were part of the
scenario and were increasing. These were the result of detonation
of anti-air missiles shot from ground territory. <a title=
"Flight on the B-17 Flying Fortress, 'the Memphis Belle' with veteran William Yepes"
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z66c8RbgFo">They were always
apprehensive and concerned</a>, or scared, because the flak was
coming up, the blue black puff of seemingly innocent smoke is a
bomb exploding. If that blew near to the wing, it would take the
whole wing off. At that height, the enemy aim was very bad and most
missiles would dischard before hitting the aircrafts, but many
discharged close enough to the formation that many aircrafts had
missing parts. Some of B-17 downed and others were out of sight
into enemy territory. It was time to hold strong, keep to the
Formation. The crew was plenty busy.</p>

<p>The American crew knew that if the German bombardiers ceased
firing, enemy aircrafts would soon come firing from any side in the
sky.</p>

<p>All anticipation culminated in the most important moment of the
mission and their their sole purpose: drop the bombs and check
whether they hit the targets. The targets were usually buildings
and facilities that upon destroyal would warrant devastating
political and economical impact.</p>

<p>Bombs dropped and the photograph plates were exposed. At that
point, the first half of the mission had been done. It was the most
important part but also the easiest, as they took the enemy by
surprise upon arrival. The second part was most dangerous, the crew
would try and return to the air base.</p>

<p>With the expertise of all men aboard, and some luck, they all
landed well enough. Many of the return crew members who landed were
badly injured, some dead and others intact. All of them, without
exception, held strong to their honour and returned to America with
glory. All survivor soldiers were received back with the utmost
respect and love from their compatriots and friends. Those soldiers
would be recognized for their impetuous spirits and firm minds.
They would now return home and train new people, tell them what
happened at the war front and how that was done.</p>
