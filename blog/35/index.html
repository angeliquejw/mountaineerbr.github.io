<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->

<p>Google Analytics is such naughty software. I can't bear it
anymore.</p>

<p>Some of the things that annoy me are the data presentation
interface, which makes heavy use of java (I suppose and I don't
much care). That is extremely slow to load and process the
data.</p>

<p>The interface is not very responsive when it is fully loaded,
either. It has got a lot of options but most of them don't make a
whole lot of sense to me.</p>

<p>It is clear <strong><abbr title=
"Google Analytics">GA</abbr></strong> does not show the raw data
and try to make some specifics obscure. As my website has got
little traffic, I can see how badly GA tries to hide me the little
data there actually was collected from users!</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Comma Separated Value">CSV</abbr> spreadsheets
are terrible, <abbr title="In My Humble Opinion">IMHO</abbr>.</p>

<p>That is a sure thing GA first collects a whole lot of data from
my visitors and only after processing that it shows me some of it
in whatever representations GA thinks is better for their
webmasters `<abbr title="users">useds</abbr>'.</p>

<p>Plus, its interface is very slow to load because it collects
data from we, webmasters, as well! There is no limit for whatever
garbage data they collect... If GA would only show me what GA
sees...</p>

<p>Once I tried a service called <em>matomo</em>, but was wary soon
after reading its terms of use. And mind that the only statistics
it showed me was a <strong>hit counter</strong>...</p>

<p>If anyone knows of a <strong>clean, simpler and better
service</strong>, <a href="../../contact/">please let me know</a>.
Whatever a simple webmaster wants from simple statistics..</p>

<p>I will remove GA scripts from my webpage in the following days.
I am still deciding what method (<code>sed -i</code> or <a title=
"Perl Pie : Replace String in Files" href=
"http://perlpie.com/"><code>perl -pie</code></a>) and regular
expression to use, or whether manually...</p>

<p>As for now, you can check webpage sources, press [CTRL+U] in
Firefox or Chrome.</p>

<p>Besides adding GA to the &lt;FOOTER&gt; section of webpages (as
opposed to Google recommendation to adding it to the &lt;HEADER&gt;
section), I know <code>uBlock</code> can block GA scripts (at least
partially) from loading.. GA scripts should not be one of the first
things to load in the webpage or at all..</p>

<p>More two bad factors in using these analytics: a) I don't know
how many of these `<em>unique</em>' users are not actually myself
as I did not set filters to prevent that and b) there were at least
three days with intense robot crawlings from various parts of the
world. So I reckon most of the data available to me may be garbage
at this point.</p>

<h2>Google Analytics Data</h2>

<p>So, before I just forget about GA, I am downlaoding some of
their CSV files. Available data is about the same as that shown to
me in GA web console.</p>

<p>In the next table, that is the full data about <em>Location</em>
of visitors since my website started using GA about 7 months ago,
which is what mostly I wanted to know after the total hit
count.</p>

<p>This data appears to have robot attacks filtered out, so I will
assume these are reasonable numbers.</p>

<p>If reasonably correct with due reservations, I am quite pleased
with the reach of my website for this period.</p>

<p>But as Rob Willians from <a href="http://www.ratz.com/">Ratz</a>
would say, <q>who cares about page views [in a personal
website]?</q></p>

<p>Besides GA not collecting data from me and my visitors, pages
should load faster.</p>

<p>I removed GA from HTML templates for the blog and podcast,
recreated all blog pages and opted by purging the other few HTML
files (about 13) manually, so I would not lose <em>vim
undoes</em>..</p>

<p>Github history (objects) of this website repo will also be
removed..</p>

<h2>Vaccine Frustration</h2>

<p>Mum got vaccinated when her age group was eligible on
Monday.</p>

<p>Today, Wednesday, I tried to bring my aunt, who lives in a close
city to my town, to vaccination because her age group would have
become eligible.</p>

<p>However, as I had last asked about vaccination on Monday and did
not confirm the schedule on Tuesday (yesterday), it was only too
late when we arrived at the vaccination center and discovered it
had been suspended the previous day..</p>

<p>Even though my aunt really does not live at town, she was born
here and always lived at the area. As mum could prove her home is
located at town, it all should be OK fr my aunt to have the
vaccine, too..</p>

<p>I take the blame for not phoning up the vaccination centre
yesterday or even this morning before taking the highway trip.</p>

<p>Politics is terrible in my country. That is mad to turn on the
TV or the radio. Pandemics, vaccination and death are the main
topics. The president is against lock down and restrictive
measures. He confuses everybody! Occasionally some weird news about
the president attending unimportant events..</p>

<p>For example, the president does not say <strong lang=
"pt">pessoas</strong> (persons, citizens) cleanly but also mouths
<strong lang="pt">pensões</strong> (pensions) when talking about
the pandemics..</p>

<p>I wonder what he is really at.</p>

<p>Relative numbers about the pandemics and vaccination mark Brazil
in bad positions internationally. I see the USA has got too many
vaccines in comparison to the rest of the world in absolute
numbers. That is not OK, either..</p>

<p>This is a somewhat stressful and frustrating day.. I am having
some beer..</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>PS</strong>: even though I removed all GA scripts from
my webpages two days ago, today I was checking GA console and
another bot attack was recorded yesterday (9 Apr), which I reckon
is not possible..</p>

<p>May that be Google injects <em>weyrd</em> numbers itself to
confuse and obfuscate real data? It may be possible. I am glad
about not using GA anymore..</p>

<p>But that is also possible this last bot attack at least was
performed on a <a title="We are at the WayBack Machine!" href=
"https://web.archive.org/web/2020*/https://mountaineerbr.github.io/">
copy of my old website</a>.. Cannot discard this possibility.</p>

<p><strong>PPS</strong>: Robots are really crazy, at least I feel
like <em>something</em> does like my blog.. Once some good YouTube
bots left comments. After I mistreated their comments (removed
them), they gradually stopped commenting, so I am reasonably sure
those were <em>good</em> YouTube bots..</p>
