<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->

<p>In the past few days I have been working on my website layout
redesign of the main navigation bar. Finally, I am satisfied with
the results. The <strong>blog</strong> proper uses a navigation bar
from W3.CSS framework so I will just leave that as it is for
now.</p>

<p>I have been sending a lot of curriculums for many private
companies and i got no answer back, except one saying I was removed
from their selection but would still be in the data bank for
another opportunity.. However, the e-mail was for a
3<sup>rd</sup>-party contractor which omitted the company's name I
applied for.. 😐</p>

<p>I am using my own shell solution to manage my blog and that is
working fine, although the code looks big at this point, but I am
only doing small modification for improvements as time goes by.</p>

<p>I got inspired by <a href=
"http://johnbokma.com/articles/tumblelog/">John Bokma's</a>
<code>tumblelog</code> scripts that generate an <b>RSS</b>
<strong>and</strong> <b>JSON</b> feeds. A <i>JSON feed</i> is over
the top for me at this point, plus <i>RSS feeds</i> are well
adopted so I thought I would try and make my own <em>RSS generator
script</em>. There is plenty of code I was able to use from my
<code>blog.sh</code> shell script, plus I found this nice <a href=
"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24984162/xmlstarlet-utf-8-nordic-characters">
Stack Overflow thread</a> and decided to go with
<code>xmlstarlet</code>, even though it is not too difficult to
generate my <a href="../../sitemap.xml">sitemap.xml</a> file with
shell and <code>sed</code>.</p>

<p>I am now trying to understand some more about <i>XML</i> in
general.</p>

<h2>Some RSS Feeds</h2>

<p>I am studying some <i>RSS feeds</i> from some high-quality
people.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://stallman.org/rss/rss.xml">Stallman's</a>
</li>

<li><a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml">Luke Smith's</a>
</li>

<li><a href="https://archlinux.org/feeds/news/">Arch News Forum</a>
</li>

<li><a href="http://johnbokma.com/index.rss">John Bokma's RDF
feed</a>
<br>
(which is <a href=
"https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_rdf.asp">another beast</a>
completely)</li>
</ul>

<p>I shall clone Richard Stallman <i>RSS feed</i> template,
including namespaces define in the <i>XML</i> document, but I will
try and avoid using <code>&lt;![[CDATA]]&gt;</code> arrays for
pasting <em>HTML</em> code under the item's <q>description</q> tag
as in Luke Smith <i>RSS feed</i>.</p>

<p>Although here is the catch, I will not paste unescaped
<i>HTML</i> code and will follow Arch <i>RSS feed</i> scheme.
Luckily, <code>xmlstarlet</code> can do that escaping for us!
Meaning that <i>HTML code</i> will be translated into <i>HTML
entities</i>, but that will generate parsing errors if I wrote
<i>HTML entities</i> in the raw blog post myself.. Need to think
more about this.. Just use <code>&lt;![[CDATA]]&gt;</code> arrays
as in Stallman's feed?</p>

<p>I reckon our <i>RSS feed</i> should stay compatible with
standards this way but of course it will comply better over time as
I adjust it..</p>

<p>I am just not sure if only a brief <em>summary</em> of the blog
article or the whole blog article should de added in the <i>RSS
feed</i>. Luke Smith does that sloppily because he cannot use all
<i>HTML</i> elements, just simple ones such as
<code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> according to
<a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/RssContent">this reference</a>, so
lets see what sort of HTML he injects in his new feed..</p>

<p>Note: Luke has just changed his <em>RSS feed</em> and is using
<code>&lt;![[CDATA]]&gt;</code> now.. Indeed, he has been
redesigning <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/">his whole website</a>
recently.</p>

<figure><img src="lukerss.png" alt="" width="505" height="267">
<figcaption>Fig 1. Just like my own RSS feed, Luke's feed is also
having some heavy design updates..</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> tag <strong>is</strong>
reserved for the blog posting system, however the way that is
planned to be used is to <em>optionally</em> write a summary for
each article in a <em>different language</em> other than the post
itself (so content can reach a more different visitors that way,
even if partially).</p>

<p>That will not do for the <i>RSS feed</i> system, though.. If I
cannot include the full blog post content (with the exception of
graphics), then I will just <code>head</code> the post content and
add that to the <i>RSS feed</i> entry, <em>OR</em>,
<code>grep</code> the <em>description metatag</em> of each blog
article, which I need always fill manually (for Search Engines)
anyway..</p>

<p>Hopefully, there will soon be an <strong>RSS feed</strong>
button in the blog homepage..</p>

<hr>

<p>It seems that the right way to do this is to use
<code>xmlstarlet</code> and comply with its bidding. The following
quote made me realise this:</p>

<blockquote>It comes down to this: XML is not a string. Don't treat
it as one. Don't use or create tools that treat XML as a string.
XML requires a parser - and all conforming parsers will do the
right thing in this situation.
<br>
--<a href=
"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33236078/why-xmlstarlet-replaces-to-gt-in-a-string">Tomalak</a></blockquote>

<p>In reality we should not be adding much more than a simple
description in the <i>RSS</i> <code>description</code> tag, you can
escape some <i>HTML</i> code but <code>xmlstarlet</code> will throw
some errors because of <i>strings</i> such as <q>=&amp;gt</q> in
<i>URLs</i>, which really should be encoded in the first place but
we are not so perfect..</p>

<p>Stallman bypasses that using <code>&lt;![[CDATA]]&gt;</code>
array and adding unescaped <i>HTML code</i>, such as <em>URLs</em>,
etc to it. Arch New feed translates <i>HTML code tags</i> to
<i>HTML entities</i>, which should be treated as proper <i>HTML
code</i> by the <i>RSS parser</i> when reading the
<code>&lt;![[CDATA]]&gt;</code> field (hopefully)..</p>

<p>Either we can go simple and use <code>xmlstarlet</code> help or
we can go nuclear the Stallman's way and use <code>sed</code> to
generate our <i>RSS</i> document.</p>

<p>There does not seem to be a single way of encoding data in
description in <i>RSS 2.0</i> as explained in the last references
above.</p>

<hr>

<p>For simple descriptions with few and simple <i>HTML</i> tagging,
<a href=
"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5272819/xmlstarlet-parser-error-entity-not-defined">
TrinitronX's answer</a> at Stack Overflow suggests using
<code>tidy</code> and transform named entities to numeric entities
plus converting <i>HTML</i> to <i>XHTML</i>, which seems to work to
inject almost any <i>HTML</i> data in the
<code>&lt;description&gt;</code> element.. However, that will fail
if you have escaped <i>HTML entities</i> in you <i>HTML</i> codes.
Also, <code>xmlstarlet</code> does not care about
<code>&lt;![[CDATA]]&gt;</code> tags and will escape/convert all
<i>HTML</i> code to entities..</p>

<p>I was considering creating <strong>two channels</strong> in a
single <i>RSS feed</i>, one with just a description of each post
and another one with the full content of posts, which is generally
more useful.</p>

<p>Instead of using <em>two channels</em>, there is an alternative
using Atom namespaces but I don't see any major benefit plus I need
studying Atom more..</p>

<blockquote>In case of Atom, you could even provide both in the
same feed: a content element for the full content, and a summary
element for the excerpt. (I guess other feed formats allows this,
too.)

<p>I installed <a href=
"https://newsboat.org/"><code>newsboat</code></a>, available from
the official repos. <a href=
"../../repo/dotfiles/.newsboat/config">After configuring it</a>,
that seems a really cool cli news aggregator, I recommend it! I am
also testing <a href=
"https://quiterss.org/"><code>QuiteRSS</code></a> (GUI, on
reconsideration, it is a very impressive reader), Thunderbird
add-on <a href=
"http://gnome.eu.org/index.php/Evolution_RSS_Reader_Plugin"><code>evolution-rss</code></a>
(very good!), Firefox add-on <a href=
"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/livemarks/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search">
Livemarks</a> (rather simple), and <a href=
"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.madsvyat.simplerssreader&hl=en&gl=US">
RSS Reader</a> (for Android). They all behave in different
ways..</p>

<p>I added <code>&lt;link rel="alternate"
type="application/rss+xml" title="Biology Blog RSS"
href="rss.xml"&gt;</code> to the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> of
<i>index.html</i> to reference the <i>RSS Feed</i>.</p>

<p>After a lot of trying, I decided to go the Stallman way and
release two feeds, the <a href="../rss.xml"><span class=
"arialbfont" style=
"font-style:italic; font-variant: small-caps; color:crimson; background:orange;padding:.2em;">
Default RSS Feed</span></a> which shall contain only short
descriptions of posts and the <a href="../rss_alt.xml"><span class=
"arialbfont" style=
"font-style:italic; font-variant: small-caps; color:crimson; background:orange;padding:.2em;">
Alternative RSS Feed</span></a> which shall contain full content of
posts injected within <code>&lt;![[CDATA]]&gt;</code> arrays (and
is bigger in size).</p>

<hr>

<p>Testing my feeds with <code>newsboat</code> and there seems that
some bad or complex HTML code in my posts may make
<code>newsboat</code> parser go nuts at times.</p>

<p>As <i>RSS</i> really stands for <em>Really Simple
Syndication</em>, and that is so easy to open the full content in a
proper (cli) web browser with <code>newsboat</code> and other
<em>RSS feed readers</em>, I have decided that the main feed will
contain short descriptions of blog post entries and there will be
an alternative feed for full content, for those who want it. But I
cannot guarantee your news reader will process the alternative feed
correctly..</p>

<p>Even though delivering full content by defaults would seem the
most useful approach for the visitor, my posts do contain a lot of
HTML code and thus really <strong>are not</strong> supposed to be
parsed by the <i>RSS feed reader</i>.. For example, if I wrote
posts in <code>markdown</code>, that could easily be converted to
simple HTML, encoded appropriately and injected in the <i>RSS
feed</i>. When received, it would be parsed correctly by the RSS
feed reader.</p>

<p>Another factor involved is size. The short description feed is
more than 10 times smaller in size than the full-content feed
(16.28KB vs 171.15KB).</p>

<p>If you are subscribed to the main RSS feed already, hopefully
there may be some problems on your side when I do the switch. If
so, <strong>please remove and re-add my feeds</strong>.</p>

<p>Specially now that I am also setting proper <em>guids</em>
<em>(global identifiers))</em> to my feeds. Eventually, I will need
<em>guids</em> unrelated to my website address to make sure items
are unique for podcast items and permanent whenever I move from
website host (currently github)!</p>

<p>The feed<strong>s</strong> should be stable in a matter of few
days.. Sorry about any inconvenience while I get all that sorted
out..</p>
