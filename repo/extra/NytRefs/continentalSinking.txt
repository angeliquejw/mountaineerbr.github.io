SCIENCE WATCH; Continental Sinking By Walter Sullivan March 30, 1993 The New

The continents, "floating" on the earth's denser interior, have sunk as much as 
two miles below their "proper" height, according to a report in the February 
issue of Geophysical Research Letters. The researchers propose that the 
continents may be being pulled down by the flow of cold, dense rock originating 
on the ocean floors and descending 400 miles or more beneath earth's land areas.

It has long been assumed that the continents float on the underlying rock, just 
as an iceberg floats in water. Evidence for this has been the rebound of a 
landscape, like central Canada, after an icecap has melted.

This rebound demonstrated that the interior of the earth was sufficiently 
plastic to flow. The new report, by A. M. Forte, A. M. Dziewonski and R. L. 
Woodward from Harvard University and W. R. Peltier from the University of 
Toronto, estimates the average height of the continents, assuming they are in 
floating equilibrium, and finds that they are now considerably lower.

The researchers noted that the downward flow is also thought to be responsible 
for the "drift" of the earth's tectonic plates.
