<!-- SUMMARY IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGE -->

<div lang="pt" class="p-summary">
<p>Tenho lido muitas notícias e visto vídeos porém tomam muito
tempo que eu poderia estar usando para estudar algo mais produtivo:
a lei ambiental brasileira!</p>

<p>E <em>toda</em> ela, inclusive. Sabendo primeiro a lei seca,
esse conhecimento abrirá portas de emprego tanto públicos como
privados.</p>

<p>Pretendo enquanto ler alguns blogs de biologia para me animar
nas próximas semanas, vou me organizar, compilar as leis e começar
a estudá-las com mais foco..</p>
</div>

<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->

<p>Since this blog started, I have been searching for other biology
blogs, web tips and such. Many blogs are seemingly abandoned or
perhaps their authors could not keep up with posting frequency but
nonetheless plan to update them later.. It was possible to find
many short blogs, which I tried to promptly read or skim through,
and some longer ones, which will demand more time.</p>

<p>Below is a short list of the blogs I want to take my time and
explore in the following weeks.</p>

Life of a Field Biologist</a>

<p>There are some books in bookshelves and in boxes to avoid their
collecting dust. Most of my books are second-hand although there
are a few which cost a lot. It took many years to grow my personal
library. As I still have not read all of them, I have been avoiding
to buy more books; now I try to download those books I want to
keep.</p>

<p>Until recently, I mostly read news sites, forums, tutorials
websites, manuals or university-related papers on the internet, so
I did not read a physical book from head to tail regularly lately..
The problem is there is so much diverse types of text I read on the
internet of which much is absolutely garbage, like for example
politics. That can and should be avoided because that takes so much
of my time. I will not digress much but I will only say YouTube
videos have drawn a terrible token on me, too, time-wise..</p>

<p>I want to change that, revert to spending my time reading and
dreaming about how I could accomplish things eventually in the
future with good company from the book author and their ideas
flowing in my mind.. Nothing better than to carefully choose a book
for reading. There are so many good books to choose from written
over millennia.. Think about that!</p>

<p>The most relevant literature I must take is also the most
boring: environmental law. And <em>all</em> of Brazil environmental
law is important.</p>

<p>Since I got my master's degree, I got to know bitcoin and did
not study environmental law very much.. Finance was a universe I
was not familiar with. Indeed most of my initial investment capital
was brutally scammed in the first months and only now, almost two
years and a half later, is that I am barely on the green (up eight
percent total).. But I cannot be too hard on myself as there was
absolutely no one to help me learning crypto and finance in general
and I was on my own. I reckon this enterprise will prove a lot more
profitable over time and I will have got some sound money.</p>

<p>That only will not make me rich. That is why I need focus on
environmental law so I can try and get a good public gov't or
private job position. <a title=
"Do you really want to be a generalist?" href=
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRhnqJQ3N6g">Ted Nelson talks
about generalistimos</a> in one of his videos. His first advice is
to know the law, specially if you want to be a consultant.</p>

<p>So my plans are to keep on reading those biology blogs to get
some inspiration instead of "news" or YouTube videos, compile and
study all the environmental law. Not easy but that is what I need
do.</p>

<p>Also, this time of year until December is a great window for
sending curriculum to private companies. I did that already soon
after I got my master's degree and was unsuccessful but that is a
good idea to try again (and again next year!).</p>
