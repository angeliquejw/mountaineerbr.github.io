<p>The first post of this website is to sync its code to GitHub. I
started learning shell scripting about one year and three months
ago and simple html code seems a good next choice because of its
usefulness.</p>

<p>Watching <a href=
"https://www.youtube.com/c/m1xolyd1an_bitcoin_tutorials/">m1xolyd1an</a>
videos about Bitcoin got me excited about html. He uses JavaScript
and NodeJS, I reckon, to do maths to <a href=
"https://github.com/coinables/">hash Bitcoin addresses</a> and some
html, too.</p>

<p>Plus, it struck me just the other day I could make my father,
who is a lawyer, a website (he said he has got one but I could not
find it on the internet).</p>

<p>Also, a friend of mine asked me to help him make a website last
year and I could not be helpful (he has got a very stylish website
now, he paid a professional, which I am glad for!).</p>

<p>Next step, I will detach this post from the front page --
ok!</p>

<p>This post will have to become a rough draft for an html post
skeleton for future posts..</p>

<p>A very good website structure is needed to be able to scale the
amount of code without much frustration..</p>

<p>Setting meta tags for <q>&lt;head&gt;</q> seems to be majorly
important.. Interestingly, Luke Smith webpage has got almost no
meta tags.. Actually, many websites don't seem to care about html
tags at all, with the exception of the charset and http-equiv
attributes.</p>

<hr>

<p>It has been a few days since I started studying html for this
website project. Now I am checking lots of websites source code. In
Firefox, just press <q>&lt;CTR+U&gt;</q> to see the source
code.</p>

<p>This website may seem already abandoned, but in fact, I have
been putting some effort in writing good source html code in the
three pages this web site has already got. Specially, I was worried
about the meta tags, and now many important ones are added to the
<q>&lt;head&gt;</q> section of the pages.</p>

<p>A visitor counter is added to the home page, but visibility is
not enabled and I am not sure whether leaving it on is any good,
because I cannot be sure what external scripts <em>they</em> may be
running with my visitors, plus as I will access my website the most
frequently, probably it will count only my own traffic..</p>

<p>That would be very similar to GitHub traffic to my repos, though
I am not 100% sure, much of the traffic GitHub shows me in the
insight section seems to be from myself when re-cloning own repos
to update them.. Sometimes it is clear there is some traffic not
from me, though..</p>

<p>I had to finally deal with solving a problem with my vim
configuration.. The problem was using a parentheses colourising
plugin from Luochen1990 called <a href=
"https://github.com/luochen1990/rainbow"><code>rainbow</code></a>,
which just messed up my syntax highlighting.. I removed it and now
set to using kien's <a href=
"https://github.com/kien/rainbow_parentheses.vim"><code>rainbow
parentheses</code></a> which is a little harder to use and has got
a hidden command <code>RainbowParenthesesLoadChevrons</code> but
that, I am mostly sure, is to avoid new users enabling it with
incompatible language highlighters on. For example, the rainbow
chevrons option must not be enabled when html syntax highlighting
is also enabled, unless you want to break the html syntax
highlighters..</p>

<p>Also, installed mattn's <a href=
"https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim"><code>vim-emmets</code></a>
plugin, which really helps with writing html tags.. I actually
found that on Arch Linux User Repository (<abbr title=
"Arch Linux User Repository">AUR</abbr>) .</p>

<p>I am being careful to writing these canonical html source pages
because if I do hurry up and write bad html sources, I would need
rewriting them later at some point. When my studying of Dan's Web
Tips is finished (see reference above), I will be ready..</p>

<hr>

<p>PS: I have included a google analytics script in the home page
and will leave that on for some time, just to see how that works
for now.
<br>
I checked Dan's web tips website and he has got an
analytics/statistics script, so maybe that is not 100% an evil
thing to do.. He also seems to have had a simple visitor counter
before that, which is now commented out in the page HTML code.. I
checked and it reached 38000+ hits before being commented out in
favor of his new analytics script..</p>

<p>PPS: it seems that the bad thing is not really getting website
guest statistics as much as showing ads! Content quality may
decrease when all the author wants is the advertisement revenue..
For example, youtube incites vlog authors to make any type of
content in large quantities in order to have channel monetisation
via ad views..</p>

<p>PPPS: one of the trackers I was testing uses a third-party
services matomo [[dot]] org which seems a very suspicious company.
As their advertising of user information collection and selling is
so outspoken in their website, I am removing it.. I will leave
Google Analytics, though.</p>
