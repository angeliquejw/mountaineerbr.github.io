<p>Produzi este gráfico com os índices da BLX e marcações de pontos de resistência de várias fontes. Penso em vender um pouco do meu hodl quando for a hora pois viso a diversificação de bens (eqüidade) líqüidos, como ações, títulos e <span lang="pt" title="grana, dinheiro vivo">cash</span>.</p>

<p>Warning: this is not a financial recommendation. Please <abbr title="Do Your Own Research">DYOR</abbr>!!!</p>
<p>Yellow bars are clones from the 2014 peak and red bars are from the 2017 peak. I aligned the previous peak of each of these points (2011 and 2014, respectively) to the BLX index candlestick graph.</p>
<p>Horizontal lines I reckon I got from some issue of <a id="bloomberg" title="Bloomberg Crypto Outlook" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/bloomberg-crypto-outlook/">Bloomber Crypto</a>. That is actually a <a href="https://mountaineerbr.github.io/blog/34/1029441_Crypto-Mar2021Outlook.pdf">very good and dependable resource</a>. Bloomberg is always clear when sharing their data analysis of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>I also set <a title="John Bollinger&#39;s twittr" href="https://twitter.com/bbands">Bollinger Bands</a>, as reccomended by <a title="YouTube channel Surfing The Market" hreflang="pt" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5oBF16le6GZ_EFSinjFu3w">Didi Aguiar</a> from <a hreflang="pt" href="https://www.dojistar.com.br/">DojiStar</a>, a Brazilian analyst. The green support line is a long-term trend line with the first point on September 2015 and the bottom of March 2020.</p>
<p>I reckon we go up from here and I plan to start selling close to or at <a href="https://twitter.com/maxkeiser">Max Keiser</a> prediction of 220K Bitcoin this year.</p>
<p>Just selling a portion of my hodl so I can further reinvest in other liquid assets such as <strong>stocks, bonds and cash</strong>. I am very interested about diversification of my <strong>equity</strong>, as <a href="https://homeytel.medium.com/">Ugly Old Goat</a> would say.</p>
<p>This year, I started thinking about my retirement because it will take a long time to prepare for that, so better if I start doing something for it <abbr title="As Soon As Possible">ASAP</abbr>. There are some great videos of <a title="Understanding Retirement Accounts by Tyler Jenks" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v-hJPbcwbQ">Tyler Jenks</a> on retirement which I will be watching again..</p>
<p>There is also a great investor in Brazil who teaches a lot about a retirement wallets, the great <a title="ações garantem o futuro" hreflang="pt" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Uv10ZCAPgsbTOOBzSKk1w">Luiz Barsi</a>.</p>
