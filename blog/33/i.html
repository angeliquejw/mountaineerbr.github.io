<!-- SUMMARY IN ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE -->
<div lang="pt" class="p-summary"><p>
Comentando sobre mais algumas configurações que fiz depois
de gravar o último podcast sobre <code>bitcoind</code>.
Pretendemos dominar as configurações necessárias para
poder retransmitir dados para as redes <span lang="en"><em>clearnet</em></span>
e <span lang="en"><em>onion</em></span> do bitcoin.
</p>
<p>Também falo sobre uma experiência curta colhendo soja em uma empresa
privada, montando um servidorzinho em casa, usar acesso SSH em casa e mais.</p>
</div><br>


<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->
<h2>Main Topic - More Tor, Router and Bitcoind Configuration</h2>

<p>There are some more important tweaks to improve connectivity of
<code>bitcoind</code> that I did not talk about in the last audiocast
episode. That is because I learned more stuff after that recording
which I reckon is worth telling my audiocast listeners
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/XGNUBio">subscribers on YouTube</a>.
</p>

<p>I will go through some more configs and comment on them.
Basically, we want to build a node which can help synchronisation
between <em>clearnet</em> and <em>onion</em> networks.
</p>

<p>Also, some more configs are needed to make your IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
available to other nodes, so they can connect to your node.
When properly configured, the node can <strong>listen</strong> to requests
and <a href="../31/">listen to <strong>inbound connections</strong></a> to rebroadcast
mempool transactions, transaction index, blocks, IP and Onion
addresses, and so on..
</p>

<p>Personally, I use my bitcoin node for retrieving some transaction info
and mempool info. I don't use that software as a wallet and my node
does not do mining (obviously).</p>

<p>Ultimately, we will make our node available only at the onioin network
and keep it synchronised. If there is a need to broadcast own transactions
or to help the networks,
it is easy to change configs and start listening to other nodes
instead of just receiving data.
</p>

<p>It is up to the user to choose what configs to set in order to run
the node the way he wishes. My public dotfiles have got all options set
to run on IPv4, IPv6 and Onion networks.</p>

	<li>Setting up a small server at home</li>
	<li>Fun with OpenSSH and Linux system management</li>

	(Andreas Antonopoulos videos on mempool are more technical
	but Tone's takes on the mempool in this video, not his guest,
	are really interesting, too)</li>
</ul>


<h2>ERRATUM</h2>
<p>During the podcast, I messed up <em>inbound</em> and <em>outbound</em>
connection names..
<strong>Outbound connections</strong> are connections your node initiates
whereas <strong>inbound connections</strong> are initiated by other nodes
when connecting to yours.
</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>PS:</strong> Following Tone's advice of using fees no lower than
5 sat/vB, I set my sweep transaction fees to 6.1 and 6.2 sat/vB and within
24 hours they were included in the blockchain during the weekend!
Finally, those sweeps are done.. Remember, I have been trying to
sweep these wallets with very low fees for almost 4 weeks now..</p>
