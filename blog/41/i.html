<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->
<p>As mentioned in previous posts, it was so much fun to develop
shell scripts which generate static webpages for the website.
</p>

<p>I don't programme in C but use many C blobs (programmes)
in my scripts.</p>

<p>After almost one year developing my own tools, I don't regret
not learning Jekyll or WordPress. I am sure these scripts will work
for a long time, but I will get into details.</p>

<p>I started writing specific scripts that would accomplish one task.
Some tasks depend on each other so I wrote some scripts which
run them in the rigt order in each section or directory of the website.</p>

<p>As such, that is enough for me to run a single script at 
the website root and all sections of the website will be updated!</p>


<p>The good thing about these scripts is I tried to keep each
performing a single function. As such, I can reuse these scripts
for creating independent sections in future websites.
</p>

<p>
However, these scripts depend on specific directory hierarchies and
templates, even though I made my best to avoid minor or accidental changes
to the templates breaking the processing and setting the major variables
correctly should make the processing work with different file structures.
</p>

<p>I don't expect anyone to actually use these scripts for his own blog,
but i am sure there are some good ideas and chuncks anyone can find useful
for his own set of poor man webmaster tools.</p>

<p>Just a note, the scripts could be much, much more simple
had I chosen not to strictly follow standards and validation tests
as a means to learning HTML, CSS and management.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, to running all the scripts take less than 20 seconds,
or less than 40 seconds when regenerating all buffers and pages..
What may take some time is pushing large data to git (for example, audio)
and now the new script which archives some of repos for distribution,
but that should not be run everytime..</p>


<h2>System overview</h2>

<h3>The Blog System</h3>
<p>This was the first system to be created.
It checks all blog entries with globs for <code>/blog/[0-9]+/</code>
but with <code>zsh</code> <em>extended globbing</em>, which really
makes life easier.</p>

<p>There is a template file copy called <code>i.html</code> inside the entry directory
which holds the author original text of the blog entry in HTML.
It would be OK to use markdown however markdown is very limited
in comparison of what structure and formatting HTML allows.</p>

<p>
The script will read many HTML tags, such as
[DESCRIPTION], [KEYWORDS], [DATE] and [TITLE] and
generate title lists for the blog homepage
and of the latest 10 posts for the website homepage,
and generate a webpage with all post concatenated. For this last task,
the script leaves some buffer files behind for speed improvement
in the following runs. As long as the original <code>i.html</code>
and buffer modification dates are the same, the old buffer is reused.
</p>

<p>That was a very important decision to start using <code>tidy</code>,
the granddaddy of HTML tools for procssing HTML.
We can expect <code>tidy</code> having a definite output once you configure
it to your needs. That allows us to work realiably on obtaining and
modifying data from specific fields with <code>sed</code> and
other tools.</p>


<p>
Recently, an option was added which generates a new post from
a template directory and automates most required tasks, such as setting
the number and date of the post. Before, I had to manually copy the template
directory, which really only holds the template <code>i.html</code> file,
and set all properties manually.</p>
	


<h3>Sitemap System</h3>
<p>Soon after the website was holding a little of interesting and
original content, I set up search engines craws to my website
in order to try and figure among their search results.
</p>

<p>
The biggest ones to sign up for (even though they should reach your
website in due course of time automatically) were
Bing and Google. Both of these websites offer a console for checking
data from search egines and that is all and the only data
I know is currently collected from their users and shared with me
about my website.
</p>

<p>With this need I developed scripts to generate theree types of
sitemaps, two for <a href="../../sitemap.txt">crawling</a>
<a href="../../sitemap.xml">engines</a> and
<a href="../../sitemap.html">one for humans</a>.</p>


<h3>Blog RSS Feed System</h3>
<p>As page development progressed, my attention was caught by RSS feeds.
<a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/">Luke Smith</a> was one of the first I remember reccomending
setting up your own RSS feeds.</p>

<p>RSS feed networks work in a very 
peculiar way in which one peer can relay audio content and data to other peers.
Essentially, you are covered as copies of your podcast are broadcast
and reach the end point, the listener. Having a copy of your
content delivered to your listeners without depending too much on
thrid-party services is really satisfying.</p>

<p>Plus, working with XML files, which are HTML files with a very strict
syntax, turned out to be very useful. Mostly, we can work with XML
with <code>tidy</code> and <code>xmlstarlet</code>.
<code>xmlstarlet</code> is problably the only decent XML editor
available <abbr title="As Far As I Know">AFAIK</abbr>.
Otherwise, editing XML with <code>sed</code> is not hard
in a shell script, either.</p>

<p>In the end, I use <code>xmlstarlet</code> to edit
a basic and valid <dfn>RSS</dfn> feed
(remember, RSS stands for <em>Really Simple Syndication</em>)
with entries description taken from [DESCRIPTION] tags of blog posts
and some more metadata such as date.</p>

<p>There is also an alternative RSS feed with full content of
blog entries, which some people may prefer.
However, for adding full-HTML content in XML [DESCRIPTION] tags,
<code>sed</code> seems a better choice as it does not
care about <span style="color:green;">&lt;![CDATA[]]&gt;</span> constructs
nor does it try to parse HTML.</p>



<h3>Podcast Tumblelog and RSS Feed Systems</h3>
<p>The real professional way of streaming podcast is through
<em>RSS networks</em>. As XMl was not a monster to me anymore,
I decided to write my own audiocast RSS system.</p>

<p>The main thing with podcast RSS is you need have
at least the initial broadcast.
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/35MqDY3hWWKCack7Fpby55">Spotify</a>,
<a href="https://blubrry.com/mountaineerbr/">Blubrry</a>
and other services may eventually limit podcast storage and charge
for premium services.
</p>

<p>I could write the podcast topics in a blog entrya nd link
back to it. As podcast distribution should require including
only a (short) episode description
beyond lots of <strong>metadata</strong>,
I decided to have my podcast entries manually written
as XML files.</p>

<p>There are two types of template files.
Each audio file will need
have associate an XML file with its title, description and metadata.
That is created copying from an entry XML template.
In the next step, the script will find all XML files of episodes,
fill in all other required metadata, such as audio duration, size,
timestamps in diferent formats and will inject episode entries
into the final XML feed (from another XML template) in the correct order,
which already contains all static information about my channel.
</p>

<p>The automation of XML podcast entries was hard and time-consuming,
but after struggling with it for some days, it started to work
as expected and stabilise.</p>

<p>Even though I tried to automate fillinig in most of the metatags,
it remains a pain in the arse to fill in the required fields
of an XML template.. Still, it is so powerful what can be done
with the XML file after filling in that metadata that that
the manual work is worth it.</p>

<p>Once my RSS broadcast system was set, I set accounts
in many (about 14) podcast directories for making it available to
their users.</p>

<p>Creating a decent <a href="../podcast/">homepage for the podcast episodes</a> was possible
using <a href="https://github.com/john-bokma/tumblelog">John Bokma's tumblelog</a> engine
almost as an extra because extracting data from the podcast XML files
to use with <code>tumblelog.py</code> was a breeze.</p>


<h3>Homepage System</h3>
<p>Eventually, I decided my homepage (landing page) was crowded
and cloned content of some sections into separate pages,
such as <a href="../../links.html">links</a> and
<a href="../../quotes.html">quotes</a>.</p>

<p>The homepage system grabs the latest links and quotes and inject them
into the homepage. If the visitor wishes the complete list of links and quotes,
she can visit dedicated pages with full content and nice CSS styles.</p>

<p>Here, <code>tidy</code> is essential to work with 
well-formatted HTML for further processing and injections.</p>


<h3>Repository System</h3>
<p>Just yesterday, I had this idea of hosting my repos inside
my website. Perhaps that is not the best idea as there is
GitHub infrastructure exactly for that, but I decided to
have a go.</p>

<p>It turns out there one feature of GitHub I cannot implement,
that is to clone an entire repo (directory/folder).
One way to offer similar functionality is to offer archives of
some of my repos. That is however <strong>a shame</strong>
that GitHub does not host files over 100GB and thus I can only
serve archives of repos under 100GB.</p>

<p>This is the script which takes the longest time and is dependent
on the compression method. But this should not be run
every time, anyways, so not a problem speed-wise.</p>


<h3>Vlog System</h3>
<p>This is the latest <em>latest</em> system I developed to take care of
publishing some videos from my old <strong>YouTube channel -- X GNU Bio</strong>.</p>

<p>Before removing my YouTube channel, I decided to backup all
my videos with <code>youtube-dl</code>. The option to add meta data
to the videos is really generous and that enabled me to
automatically make pages for them for republication.
All I have got to do is to get meta data for fields such as title,
description, comment (the full YouTube video description), date and etc
with shell scripting tools and make HTML pages for them.
 </p>

<p>I gave a try to make a vlog section under my own website.
GitHub does not allow files larger than 100MB, so only about 20% of my YouTube
videos can be published over here (the smaller and shortest videos).</p>

<p>I am happy with the <a href="../../vlog/">vlog portal</a>,
and you can check some of my YouTube videos.</p>

<p>This system will only work with my YouTube videos because I downloaded them
all with the same settings and metadata available.
But eventually I may have a new vlog with more videos, but will need
a new vlog system then.
</p>

<p>One thing is for sure, we shall not return to YouTube anytime soon.</p>
