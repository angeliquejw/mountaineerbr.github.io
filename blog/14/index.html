<dt><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p08tmn3g">BBC's
podcast 'What Planet Are We On' with David Attenborough</a>
</dt>

<dd>The interviewer tried to start the conversation with hope but I
am not sure Sir Attenborough managed to to inspire her very much.
Also noteworthy how other people on the beginning of the podcasts
already forecast grievance only.</dd>

<dt><a href=

'Curb excess capitalism' to save nature</a>
</dt>

<dd>Sir Attenborough says he is not an economist, which is fine
<abbr title="In My Humble Opinion">IMHO</abbr>, however nothing
stands in the way of his learning some of that. When he says we
need to curb capitalism, what does that really mean? That does not
mean anything. Beware of vague expressions.</dd>

documentary (2019)</a>
</dt>

<dd>Usage of drones instead of narrow-angle lenses to film walruses
made them afraid and led them to falling off a cliff. Note that the
polar bear which was at the scene is only partly to blame for the
tragedy. If no drones were around, probably walruses would not just
fall off the cliff.</dd>

Food Programme wins 2020 Nobel Peace Prize, as hunger mounts</a>

<dd>Hunger is really worrying. Perhaps total world production of
food is enough for all human beings, however there is a big problem
with distributions systems. There are not enough distribution. We
need more roads to take food (and fuel and technology) to those who
live in very difficult places to access and cheap fuel.</dd>

expedition logs from Polarstern</a>
</dt>

<dd>Comments on the almost year-long transpolar-turned-peripolar
expedition of Mosaic on the German ice breaker Polarstern. A copy
of the forum thread in <a title="Topic: MOSAiC news" href=
"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mountaineerbr/extra/master/mosaic_polarstern_forum.arctic-sea-ice.net.txt">
plain formatted txt can be found here</a>. The Mosaic expedition
tried to follow the steps of the <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nansen%27s_Fram_expedition">Nansen's
Fram expedition</a> (1893–1896), which aimed to reaching the
geographical North Pole.
<br>
<a title=
"Scientists on Arctic mission make unplanned detour to pole" href=
"https://money.yahoo.com/scientists-arctic-mission-unplanned-detour-111041410.html">
This article</a> says Mosaic Polarstern reached geographical North
Pole, however the forum logs say closest approach to North Pole was
166.3 km, information from post on February 26th from <em>young
ice</em>. After the originally planned floe was abandoned during
the covid pandemics, in search for a new floe they crossed the
North Pole on August 19th, but that was a detour and not in the
original plans of the expedition.
<br>
A lot of public money was spent in this expedition, however the
scientific groups released little data and there was not a
centralised data or information supplier other than the <a href=
"https://follow.mosaic-expedition.org/">kindergarten-like
portal</a> (entering deprecation as soon as the expedition was over
last month). Most available info is spread across blog and social
media posts. Official scientific papers with data from Mosaic
expedition are planned to be released by 2023! IMHO, data should
have been streamed live from the ship and everyone should be able
to get that and do their won research, why not?!</dd>

<dt lang="pt"><a hreflang="pt" href=

</dt>

<dd>Brazilian legislation makes it hard for cabotage type of
navigation. Cabotage navigation would allow transporting a lot more
resources along the very extensive coast of Brazil. Railroad
development has been stagnant for decades in Brazil. Cabotage is
not the silver bullet for the transport problems but would greatly
help and reduce road transport.</dd>

</dt>

<dd>The Brazilian govt says Brazil is lagging 8 years behind in
genomic research. Thus, now they want to sequence 100 thousand
Brazilian genomes (who must have some sort of rare disease) in the
<strong>next four years</strong> with <a lang="pt" hreflang="pt"
href=
"https://www.oantagonista.com/brasil/governo-pretende-investir-r-600-mi-para-criar-banco-nacional-de-genomas/">
spending of R$600mi</a> (US$~107mi) and be the leading country in
that field of research. Does that make sense? Some ethical and
financial problems arise. For example, the project first aim is to
generate a said 'reference' genome of the Brazilian people. Perhaps
they could generate a reference genome for peoples from Iceland,
Norway and Japan, but hardly Brazil due to its great population
miscegenation. There are lots of gene sequences or genome
assemblies from people with rare diseases available <a href=
"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genomes/?txid=9605&term=Homo&utm_source=nuccore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=:assemb">
in publicly accessible data banks</a> and I reckon a research group
could obtain more whole genomes from specific public-restricted
banks. If Brazil groups cannot advance in genomics with data
already available, they will hardly advance with 100 thousand more
genomes because data is not automatic information!</dd>

<dl>
<dt><a href="https://archive.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux update
notes on sync'ing with Arch Linux Archive (ALA)</a>
</dt>

<dd>I sync Arch Linux with the monthly repo (snapshot of the
1<sup>st</sup> of a month) from <abbr title=
"Arch Linux Archive">ALA</abbr>. However, sometimes even the
monthly repo snapshot (which is used to generate the official Arch
Linux install iso image) is not 100% stable for my specific
hardware and thus I need to try and sync again some days later..
For example, what I do when there is news such as <q>nvidia 455.28
is incompatible with linux = 5.9</q> recently? I do not agree a
rolling release distribution requires the user to update constantly
as a rule.</dd>

<dt>Working with bitcoin private keys</dt>

<dd>How to set up a computer with a safe digital environment and
how to try and leave no records.

<ul>
<li>use a dedicated computer with a free operating system, such as
Linux distributions or BSD clones; <strong>there is no need to keep
it up-to-date</strong>, one may use a snapshot of os and download a
full copy of the official repos (usually below 50GB), for eg.
<code>wget -r -np -e robots=off
"http://manjaro.c3sl.ufpr.br/stable/"</code></li>

<li>avoid connecting to the internet while working with privy
keys</li>

href=
"https://www.linuxuprising.com/2018/04/how-to-encrypt-home-folder-in-ubuntu.html">
(i) use an encrypted disk, (ii) an encrypted user account</a> or at
the very minimum (iii) do encrypt files holding the privy keys with
eg. <code>gpg -c --personal-cipher-preferences CAMELLIA192
[FILE..]</code> . List cypher algos with <code>gpg
--version</code>. <em>Do</em> make a backup of original files as
some <code>gpg</code> versions may overwrite them!</li>

<li>remove automatic unencrypted backups made by text editors</li>

<li>avoid automatic backups by text editors (also swap and undoes),
for example, add a modeline to files opened by vi(m): <code>#
vim:nobackup noundofile</code> (maybe leave <code>noswapfile</code>
out)</li>

<li>overwrite and remove temporary or old files with <code>shred
-n1 -uv [FILE..]</code></li>

<li>make backups of your encrypted files</li>

<dd>Compulsory vaccination: is reinforcement of a covid vaccine
feasible? While OMS says SARS-CoV2 vaccine will be widely available
only in 2022, is that fair that whoever is not able to get
vaccinated until then should stay at home, isolated? There are many
bad points about compulsory vaccination:

<ul>
<li>SARS-CoV2 vaccines are still under testing, nobody know if they
are effective</li>

<li>As for all vaccines however small there is a chance of
collateral effects; that is a risk a person must decide to take or
not</li>

<li>Universality passes through the self first; in Japan, use of
masks is to protect one self, the extended benefit of protecting
others is only secondary and not as powerful as self
protection</li>

<li>The person may not even get into contact with the virus in her
lifetime</li>

<li>If a person is not able to get a vaccine, should he be
discriminated?</li>
</ul>
I reckon that when a person is diagnosed with covid or any other
contagious disease, he should stay at home but we cannot make
people stay at home or discriminate them when they are not
infected. The fears they are trying to mitigate with mandatory
vaccination cannot be universal rule itself: imagine now that we
must get a shot of vaccine for every possible disease because we
must protect "others"?</dd>

<h2>Update on 03-nov-2020</h2>

<p>If youtube analytics is saying the truth to me, most listeners
of the podcast drop before the 40min mark. That does not mean I
should dumb down the content or shorten it for the sake of what
most users do. However that was already a plan to make 40min
podcasts so that is the goal next time. Maybe I will aim at 35min
so I am sure to never run out of content!</p>

<p>I plan on recording another podcast episode only just before New
Year's day or Christmas. Let's see.</p>
