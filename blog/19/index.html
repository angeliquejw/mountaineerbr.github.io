<!-- SUMMARY IN ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE -->

<div lang="pt" class="p-summary">
<p>Semana passada, depois de procurar concursos públicos na minha
área de formação e ver que estão em baixa, decidi me oferecer a
trabalhar voluntariamente no combate à Covid de um a dois meses.
Especialmente, achei que poderia ser útil agora no final do ano,
durante as datas comemorativas, visto que muito do pessoal deve
tirar férias merecidas.</p>

<p>Mandei <a hreflang="pt" href="letter_volunteer.txt">uma
carta</a> e currículo para várias instituições em São Paulo e
algumas no Paraná. Claro, a princípio prefiro trabalhar
voluntariamente nas maiores instituições. Recebi algumas respostas,
inclusive uma surpreendente do Governador de São Paulo, João
Doria.</p>
</div>

<br>
<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->

<p>Last week I was searching for private companies to send in my
<em>curriculum vitae</em>. I also checked for public service
examinations for a position, however none was found on my area of
training.</p>

<p>There are too many stories about people needing a job who send
dozens or hundreds <abbr title="Curriculum vitae">CVs</abbr> and
receive no answer, so I prepared to not give up so soon. I actually
sent dozens of unrequested CVs to private companies about my city
at the end of 2018 and got no replies. Indeed, most companies I
sent a copy of my CV may not need a biologist, but that was worth a
try. And I am hopeful enough to do that again this year!</p>

<p>In the meantime, that would be a smart move from me to do
volunteer work against Covid. My training as a biologist may come
in handy. I do not expect to be at the front line of vaccine
research or production but maybe I could be useful for something.
As a reward, I can add the public institution name I served as a
volunteer in my CV later..</p>

<p>It has been almost 4 years since my master's degree and away
from the academy. I know teachers and other important people from
the academy have got some prejudice towards those away from the
academy for so long. I have no plans to take PhD degree nor do I
plan on teaching at universities in the foreseeable future. Yet,
there is a longing to be back within the science on the
making..</p>

<hr>

<p>I sent some presentation letters and CVs to the biggest public
institutions working against Covid, researching and producing the
vaccine. Because all my university training was completed in
various public, state and federal universities from two states
(Paraná and São Paulo), I thought it was almost <em>my duty</em> to
help in some way as retribution for all the public money invested
on me as a student.</p>

<p>These institutions or people include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Secretary of State for Health from Paraná (my state)</li>

<li>Secretary of State for Health from São Paulo (neighbour
state)</li>

<li>Secretary of State for Health <em>form</em> from São Paulo</li>

<li>Instituto Adolfo Lutz</li>

<li>Instituto Adolfo Lutz public relations department</li>

<li>Butantan Institute</li>

<li>Butantan Institute head directly</li>

<li>São Paulo governor personal e-mail (found on some document on
Google)</li>
</ol>

<p>As a last resort, I may still send an e-mail to one graduation
teacher of mine who is currently involved with the Covid programme
in my state, as she is a biochemist and immunologist. I took
internship under her tuition so she knows that I have been keen
onto immunology and molecular biology all along..</p>

<p>I got five responses in total, two of them came in quickly last
week. Mostly, they said thanks for the volunteer application and my
civility in trying to help our people.</p>

<hr>

<p>On Monday, this week, I was reading the news and there was an
interview from São Paulo governor, reprinted below from the
magazine <em><a href=
"https://www.oantagonista.com/brasil/doria-defende-frente-para-derrotar-bolsonaro/">
O Antagonista</a></em>:</p>

<blockquote lang="pt">
<h3>Doria defende frente para derrotar Bolsonaro</h3>

<p>23.11.20 07:00 [$$ 5]</p>

<p>João Doria defende uma frente ampla para derrotar Jair Bolsonaro
em 2022.</p>

<p>Ele disse para o Estadão:</p>

<p>“A frente não deve ser contra Bolsonaro, mas a favor do Brasil.
A frente deve reunir o maior número possível de pessoas e
pensamentos que estejam dispostos a proteger o Brasil e a
população. Comporta o pensamento liberal de centro, que é o que eu
pratico, mas comporta também centro-direita, centro-esquerda,
aqueles que têm um pensamento mais à esquerda e à direita. Só não
caberá o pensamento dos extremistas, até porque os extremistas não
querem compartilhar, discutir. Eles querem impor situações ao País,
tanto na extrema-esquerda, quanto na extrema-direita. Destes
extremos nós temos que ficar longe.”</p>

<p>Sobre Sergio Moro, ele disse:</p>

<p>“Ele deve fazer parte dessa frente. Tem história, biografia e
posicionamento. Nunca declarou que era candidato. Sempre teve
altivez e grandeza para defender o País, independentemente dos
interesses pessoais.”</p>

<p>The governor, João Doria, is talking about politics parties,
however as I was sort of expecting a response from him, I read
through all the nuances and extracted a message I thought was
directed for me.</p>

<p>I read it like so:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it only depended on me, those who have got loftiness and
grandeur to defend the country without personal interests in stand,
we want to gather. However, those who are right- and
left-extremists and want to impose things to their country, we must
avoid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe I should avoid sending my CV and volunteer letter
insistently? That seemed to be a very good tip from Mr Doria. That
is useful for not forcing it too much when asking for private jobs,
too.</p>

<p>Either I was becoming mad or he really did reply to me via that
interview. That would not be so surprising, after all, politics
read and hear from a lot of people and they cannot possibly reply
to everyone directly. Maybe even unconsciously, he read my e-mail
and replied to it somehow.. Humans have got some forms of
communication that are not so obvious, but that is subject for
another post.</p>

<p>As I read through his answer and that was apparently good, I
decided to take it for me, nonetheless.</p>

with Govt stamps and even a letterhead symbol saying thanks for my
being available.</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr>

<p>I don't reckon I will be sending any more CVs for volunteer
work. If they don't need me within two or three more weeks, I may
not be inclined or able to engage in that anymore. While I reckon
that may do me very well mentally and physically, I may not be
enough mentally stable to engage in that <em>yet</em>. I need focus
on private companies and public examination for a fixed position at
the local Govt, a city hall job, and also focus on my health.</p>

<hr>

<div style="visibility:visible;">
<p>PS: After answering the Governor secretary e-mail saying I felt
happy and honoured by her message to me, I remarked, a little
jokingly and good-humored, I would vote on his if he decides to run
for president in 2022.</p>

<p>Some days later, there was this another speech from him saying
he does not care about elections but the nation! Maybe I was
inappropriate? That is appropriate to be concerned about
'responsibilities' and 'service' to the community..</p>

<p>The communication channel through the news feels like it has
closed to me now.</p>

<blockquote lang="pt">
<h3>"Aqui não há foco em nova eleição, há foco em vacinação", diz
Doria</h3>

<p>29.11.20 20:04</p>

<p>Ao comemorar a vitória de Bruno Covas, o governador João Doria
defendeu o "equilíbrio, o bom senso e a capacidade de gestão".</p>

<p>"Bruno construiu sua vitória com seu programa de governo e sua
própria trajetória. Foi meu sucessor e conduziu com eficiência, com
foco. Foi brilhante, foi guerreiro, sério e dedicado."</p>

<p>Doria aproveitou para alfinetar Jair Bolsonaro, dizendo que
"aqui não tem negacionismo" e que a prioridade será a vacinação.
"Aqui não há foco em nova eleição, há foco em vacinação."</p>
