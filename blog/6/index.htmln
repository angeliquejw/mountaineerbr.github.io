<p>I reckon having a website for link collection is a good reason
for having a website. I started a new column on the website home
page, called <q>The Fool Environmentalist</q> which is supposed to
be a list with links and very short comments about some important
point. Google News always sends me good and bad articles that I
should be collecting for personal reference.. Internet news are
easy to read but very hard to keep track and organise them. Google
does not help, sometimes even Firefox isn't!</p>

<p><em>The Guardian</em> has been very disappointing for the last
decade. Too many news about how humanity is headed to total
environmental disaster.. Generically, not only <em>The
Guardian</em> here, what they completely mess up is the sense of
cause and effect. Human beings are living on Earth because the
Environment has allowed all conditions for our development and
survival at this precisa moment, so we are actually an effect of
natural forces. To think that we are the cause and source of
natural order is very naive. We may as well be, however it seems
more overwhelming that what little humans can do is due to workings
of a much greater order.</p>

<p>And here order means simply <em>physical</em> laws. Indeed,
order can emerge from chaos and they are really not different
things. We may talk more about <em>complex systems</em> in due
time.</p>

<p>I <a href="../res/script4.html">did a rewrite</a> of a shell
script to deal with updating the website blog section. I found a
very useful sed command which allowed me to write simple template
html pages to merge with the actual post content (from <a href=
"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46423572/append-a-file-in-the-middle-of-another-file-in-bash">
Stack Overflow</a>).</p>

<pre><code>$ sed '2 r file2.txt' file1.txt</code></pre>

<p>The first sed command adds text from <code>file2.txt</code> into
<code>file1.txt</code> after a specific line (in that case, line
#2). The following commands are more interesting as they add text
from <code>file2.txt</code> after a matched pattern.
<code>file2.txt</code> can be <code>/dev/stdin</code>! Also, if you
want to modify the target file, you can use flag
<code>-i</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ sed '/^PATTERN/ r file2.txt' file1.txt

$ sed -i '/^PATTERN/ r /dev/stdin' file1.txt</code></pre>

<p>I was working on the HTML and CSS code of the website for the
past days. Yesterday, I got some code snippets from <a href=
"https://www.w3schools.com/">W3</a> and made the home page
responsive. <a href=
"https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_equal_height.asp">It is
using Flexbox</a>, which, by the way, is not compatible with IE 10
and earlier.. I installed various web browsers available in the
Arch Linux official repos:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>aur/tor-browser</code>
</li>

<li><code>aur/google-chrome</code>
</li>

<li><code>community/otter-browser</code>
</li>

<li><code>community/opera</code>
</li>

<li><code>community/netsurf</code>
</li>

<li><code>community/elinks</code>
</li>

<li><code>extra/w3m</code>
</li>

<li><code>extra/lynx</code>
</li>

<li><code>extra/konqueror</code>
</li>

<li><code>extra/firefox</code>
</li>

<li><code>extra/epiphany</code>
</li>

<li><code>extra/chromium</code>
</li>

<li><code>core/links</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It is a good idea to check your website with all of these
browsers. I personally like to using W3M, however I am not that
familiar with all shortcuts yet. On the other hang, Links and
ELinks are easy to use to even have got GUI versions! They are
useful for navigating to many websites, though not all.</p>

<p>Specially useful is the Netsurf browser, which uses a simple
engine and is akin in rendering to a version of IE 10 or
thereabouts..</p>

<p>You can test your website with a different browser
(cross-browser testing) at <a href=
"https://www.browserling.com/">Browserling</a>, too.</p>
<img class="leftimg" src="../gfx/vcss-blue.gif" alt=
"[Valid CSS logo]" width="88" height="31">
<p>That is also good idea to check the code with an <a href=
"https://validator.w3.org/">HTML validator</a> and a <a href=
"https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS validator</a>. They give
you a code snippet to generate a validator logo at your website,
however if you tested your HTTP version of the website, the code
generated will make web browsers throw <a title=
"How to fix nonsecure image errors" href=
"https://www.sslshopper.com/article-stop-the-page-contains-secure-and-nonsecure-items-warning.html">
supposed errors of unsafe images</a> when accessing it with HTTPS.
In Linux, I found a very good HTML linter called <code>tidy</code>
available in the extra repo in Arch Linux. There is a good CSS
linter, albeit harder to use and requires some manual configuration
is <a href="https://stylelint.io/"><code>Stylelint</code></a>,
available in the community repo. Check the
<code>stylelint-config-standard package</code>, too. Otherwise
install via npm, check package instructions.</p>

<hr>

<p>Lastly, you can check website performance with <a href=
"https://gtmetrix.com/">GTmetrix</a>, a tip from <a href=
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHU9tx7hpqw&t=974s">Chris Titus
Tech</a>. It seems one of the most important optimisations you can
do is improve image sizes, if your webpage is too large. My home
page has approximately 200KB with images as of today..</p>

<hr>

<p>PS: these webbrowser add-ons are almost essential webmaster
tools, check <a href=
"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/">Web
Developer</a> which adds a toolbar button with various web
developer tools and <a href=
"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/http-header-live/">HTTP
Header Live</a> which displays the HTTP headers.</p>
