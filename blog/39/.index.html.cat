<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->

<p>I am really proud of my little blog system. I cannot just remove it
from the public domain reach.
The same feeling is not so strong about my YouTube Channel.</p>

<p>In fact, with very little remorse I was able to remove that on Friday.
Google (at least YouTube branch) cannot use my data and my subscribers data
as they wish anymore.
There were 258 subscribers to my YouTube channel and more than 130,
many which I am proud to have recorded, some turned out to be lessons
of didatics or lack of.. I made a copy of all of the videos with
good <code><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Youtube-dl">youtube-dl</a></code>
and for my surprise, there was
no more than 26GB of content. I know some YouTubers claim to have much more
data for content but they must mean raw content shot locally,
without edition and directly from the camera, not downloaded with:</p>

<pre><code>url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbjGrylVSBjPx02LRH7HCAA
youtube-dl -f best -ciw -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" --add-metadata -v "$url" |&amp; tee log.txt
#https://askubuntu.com/questions/856911/using-youtube-dl-to-download-entire-youtube-channel</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunatelly, I cannot host these videos on GitHub.
Many videos are heavy and long, like 40min or even longer.
I wish I could host them here, though.
Luckily, the
<a href="../podcast">podcast system</a> solves this problem,
albeit with less content..</p>

<p></p>

<hr>
<p>GitHub repos were made private, following a
<a title="DT for the closer subscribers" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DistroTube/videos">suggestion from DistroTube</a>
some time ago..
That is a relief for me. But know what,
I will make <a href="../../repo">my own version of a repo</a> and share
<em>static copies</em> of my public c files (dotfiles)
and some other interesting stuff (mostly neutral things)
that need sharing to complement my blog posts 
here and keep those dedicated GitHub repos for <em>private use</em>.
</p>

<p>Just a note, this website is
<a href="https://github.com/mountaineerbr/mountaineerbr.github.io">hosted in GitHub</a>,
so you can check it over there, too..
</p>


<hr>
<p>There are some more or less sensitive information I am removing
from this website. When other people say they have got a <em>personnal website</em>,
they don't usually mean a <em>public diary</em>, rather leave some
(hopefully useful) information and ideas for other peple to reach.</p>

<p>Things get complicated when it comes to employment. We don't
mean to scare off potential employers.. Reconsidering what to post
exatcly is a good idea. Very clear context should avoid some problems of interpretation, too.</p>

<p>That said, the website structure is growing big and may seem
like a complete mess for an outsider. One of my first intentions when
building this website was that it had <strong>depth</strong> and
there was a lot to learning shell scripting for developing
a sort of suite of <em>poor man webmaster tools</em> to manage this website.
Not too hard
but it demands effort and time. I am sure anyone can make a dream website
in details from scratch in under 9 months.
That may seem like a long time but
if you don't start, you will never get there.</p>

<p>While I don't mind using HTML docs to keeping my personal annotations like
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/XahLee/videos">Xah Lee</a>,
it is also important that the useful information in this blog be accessible
for me through any device over the internet. That is another reason
why one should have one personal website: to keep himself organised
and available reference-wise.
</p>

<hr>
<p>There are some powerful and bad peple trying to get hold of me
on personal grounds due to my
confronting their dangerous research on Brazilian people. I ought to refrain
from getting into details as a possible lawsuit may be involved.
My accusation against them is very technical and to explain it would
take a reasonable amount of time and writing.
Wish me luck, time is my best friend.</p>

<hr>
<p>Considering what I wrote in previous posts, all this builds towards my
<strong>freezing</strong>, rather than <em>removing</em>,
this website from public domain.</p>

<p>This does not mean I cannot eventually post here again but rather
I mean to have multiple websites!
That tastes like <strong>Freedom &amp; Independence</strong>!
