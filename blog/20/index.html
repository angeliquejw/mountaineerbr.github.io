<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->

<p>I have been making some charts with data from Johns Hopkins
University CSSE and Reuters News Agency to check how the number of
new cases, recovered and deaths are developing.</p>

<p>I update the charts almost everyday. You can check them at
<a href="https://github.com/mountaineerbr/coronaPlot">my github
repo of covid19 graphs</a>. Unfortunately, I only discussed my
opinion about them in one unrelated forum, needed to get those
references to put them in my blog sometime.</p>

<p>I have been very curious about another type of graphs, that of
positivity. As the amount of test number per day have been variable
since the pandemics start, I thought it would be helpful if we
could analyse the data taking out such a parameter from the
equation (in this case, graphs).</p>

<p>For one thing, we should not be keen to analyse the absolute
numbers, as there are so many diverging opinions, such as either
numbers are over or underestimated.. So they are not much good.
Let's check proportions! By the way, that is a tip from <a href=
"https://mobile.twitter.com/officialmcafee">John McAfee</a>, who is
currently in jail in Spain #freemcafee).</p>

<h2>Experimental charts for Covid19 test <em>positivity</em></h2>

<p>How many percentage points of test results are positive to
Covid19? I could not find positivity charts around with long time
series, so I decided to make some charts with Brazilian data. Below
is my try for charting data from Paraná State reports.</p>

<br>

<figure><img src="results_pr.png" alt="graph made with gnuplot"
width="800" height="600">
<figcaption>Fig 1. Positivity graph from data of the state of
Paraná. Y-axis for positivity percentage of total tests analysed,
X-axis relative date. That is one state with the lowest positivity
rate amongst all I could see with this analysis. Data ranges
between 03/feb/2020 and 06/dec/2020.</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>

<figure><img src="results_pr_long.png" alt=
"wider graph, same as fig. 1" width="3200" height="800">
<figcaption>Fig 2. Same as fig. 1, but we see absolute dates in
X-axis. I am <em>not</em> sure how to configure
<code>gnuplot</code> to show fewer x-ticks and make them more
readable, so that is why it is so wide..</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>To see charts with data from all states, check <a href=
"https://github.com/mountaineerbr/coronaPlot/tree/master/SUSOPENDATA_2020-12-24">
my corona virus repo</a>.</strong>
</p>

<p>Analysing positivity rate is independent on test capacity,
meaning it does not matter if there is more testing now than at the
pandemics start. Everything can be levelled.</p>

<p>I got the data from <a href=
"https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/dataset/casos-nacionais">SUS
OpenData</a> That is not the cleanest data. I extract values for
Positive cases and Negative cases with some
<code>awk</code>ing.</p>

<p>After download the csv files, you can check the header line
which contains the column keys:</p>

<p>The following shell function was used to calculate positivity.
The shell will loop through all csv files given and group results
by date.</p>

<p>Some <code>awk</code> conditionals will test values from columns
$12 and $30, and will decide if that will be counted as a positive
case, a negative case or be ignored. There is no guarantee this
analysis is sufficient.</p>

<p>You can check the script with some functions to process the data
at my <a href="../../repo/scripts/corona_notifyBR.sh">sub repo</a>
for covid test positivity studies.</p>

<p>The last step is to generate graphs with <code>gnuplot</code>. I
am having some difficulty with the x-ticks dates because
<code>gnuplot</code> only accepts numbers by defaults.. May as it
be, bear in mind the data start from about February and ends on
24<sup>th</sup> December.</p>

<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>Well, I have been avoiding interpreting Sars-2-Covid data too
hastily, as I am learning a lot in this pandemics from a scientific
perspective myself..</p>

<p>But the whole point of making these graphs was to try and see if
we could get a reading in which gross number of covid tests applied
would not be a variable in time analysis.</p>

<p>My experimentation is very rudimentary. I did not try to improve
the filtering of the OpenSUS data very much after the initial
effort. However, it is well-known from various news outlets that
the number of tests taken per day by patients has increased,
generally, but we also know it fluctuates over time, i.e test
production capacity has increased since the very beginning of the
pandemics, logistics has had occasional setbacks to deal with, and
also it seem reasonable that less covid tests were applied when
positive cases generally decreased, and vice-versa..</p>

<p>With more diligent work onw can smooth out the variable number
of covid tests done per day from chart data and surprising results
are to be obtained. All available points from historical data sets
ought to be used for the results of such an analysis be clear and
meaningful from a long term and wholistic perspective.</p>
