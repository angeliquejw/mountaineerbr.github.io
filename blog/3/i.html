<p>I am reading a lot of HTML code from other personal blogs/websites.. 
I am seeing all those blogs I collected over the years
in a new perspective. Some of these blogs are from people with
information technology backgrounds, and yet they seem to use <em>Jekyll</em>
or some other layout programmes, such as <em>WordPress</em> to generate pages.
See
<a hreflang="pt" href="https://aurelio.net/blog/">Aurelio Jargas' website</a>.
Aurelio is using <em>Jekyll</em> now, however it was possible
to find a
<a hreflang="pt" href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970531231058/http://www.brasmidia.com/dumbs/">very early webpage</a> of his Brazilian music group called
<cite>DUMBS</cite>
written, presumably, by himself. The webpage seems to have started
with a simple, cool design (and one picture of the band!),
which was soon after buried under a lot of litter (gifs, pictures),
which would leave important information out of sight.
Sometime later, Aurelio writes in the website logs that the page was
slow to load, too! We can compare with the
<a hreflang="pt" href="https://aurelio.net/dumbs/">music band final website</a>
he maintains as memoir of good times to this date.
</p>

<p>There is no convincing me any of these programmes end up
being easier to learn and use than to make your own webpages with
good HTML and CSS code. The principle still ought to be
a clean website with good content is superior than busy and
heavy websites.</p>
<p>It is clear that if a website grows, it starts to getting harder
to maintain the pages. However, CSS style sheets may prove
very handy for changing formatting of a series of posts.
While HTML structures the text, CSS will style it.
<br>
Not everything can be done with CSS but I reckon much can be done
without need of a complete rewrite of the website. Plus,
<em>sed</em> can be very useful in changing whole sections of HTML documents.
<em>Bash</em> may not be the most recommended language for maintenance of
a very large website, perhaps, however <em>bash</em> is already
<a type="text/plain" href="../res/script1.txt">helping me</a>
with compiling the
<a href="../cat.html">All posts</a>
page.
Every blog post has got its own manually-crafted
HTML page, with many logical tags which may serve to present this same
content in different ways for different people, for example, for
the visually impaired or the people in the future,
whenever in time.</p>

<p>Aurelio's writing style can be funny and that keeps the
reader interested. I shall try to keep this website
light-spirited, too..</p>

<p>For now, I cannot grow this website too much without further
defining and deciding on  its basic structure. For that, I may even
make some drawings on paper and try to implement that structure
in HTML code..</p>
