<p>That is so difficult to be an intelectual!</p>

<p>I was checking out BSD forms because I like BSD and plan(ned) to
migrate to BSD someday, so I like to check that out sometimes and
see what are the troubles that affect that people..</p>

<p>Today I found a very intriguing thread called <a href=
"https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/environmentalist.77011/"><strong>
Environmentalist</strong></a>, in which there is a pitiful
discussion about <em>saving the environment by setting and
fine-tuning their BSD system <strong>power plan</strong>
correctly</em>..</p>

<p>I thought the BSD people were sort of alternative people who
would care to open their minds to other possibilities. and decided
to post a reply to that thread and see if I could shed some light
on these complex environmental questions. As it turned out, they
are just as inflexible as anyone else, I am afraid. I was banned
less than 30 minutes later by allegations of spamming!</p>

<p>I sent an appeal e-mail to <em>accounts@FreeBSD.org</em> and
<em>forum-admins@FreeBSD.org</em>. Unfortunately, I do not expect
to hear back from them.</p>

<p>The following is a copy of my original reply to that thread.
Enjoy!</p>

<hr>

<p>Hallo guys,</p>

<p>The Sun still warms. There are other forces in Nature which have
got a planetary effect. Keep in mind the insignificance of humans
in the bigger space scenery. Global forcings include, the Sun by
various means, its energy flux <em>and</em> magnetic field
strength. Actually, magnetic changes of the Sun fields seem to have
a greater effect on Earth than merely Sun's energy flux. Something
that is really worrisome is the influx of cosmic rays which are
really powerful when coming from out of solar system and are
mutagenic, for the worse and for the better, but mostly bad for
humans.. Also, The Sun will affect the oceans which are able to
have a global effect, too. Still, we can go to smaller scale and
point out that volcanoes can change global temperature (albeit for
maybe only a short period of time, say months or years).</p>

<p>Why do the forces above can change Earth climate? The Sun has
got many cycles, for example one magnetic cycle that lasts 11
years, others that last hundreds of years and others thousand of
years.. These cycles all overlap each other, so they are not so
easy to identify but possible. Only recently scientists have been
questioning what are the effects of the `Galactic Current Sheet',
which crosses Earth at about 12K or so years. That is
<em>roughly</em> about the same period of time Earth uses to flip
poles..</p>

<p>Check Suspicious Observer, however take with a grain of salt his
seemingly alarmism sometimes:
<br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/ouGhtFOpaHM">Galactic Sheet Impact |
Timing the Arrival</a></p>

<p>The following article is also useful in this specific context:
<br>
<a href=
"https://watchers.news/2019/09/22/solar-system-approaching-the-closest-position-to-the-galactic-core-energetic-region-altering-magnetic-fields-of-the-sun-and-all-planets/">
Solar system approaching the closest position to the galactic core,
energetic region altering magnetic fields of the Sun and all
planets</a></p>

<p>There are some recent papers describing what I find most
fascinating and is potentially a unifying background for all this
discussion is the understanding of `Sun Inertial Motion' (SIM),
check Zharkova (she has got some lectures videos on the tubes):
<br>
<a href=
"https://sci-hub.st/https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45584-3">
Oscillations of the baseline of solar magnetic field and solar
irradiance on a millennial timescale</a>
<br>
<a href=
"https://mountaineerbr.github.io/blog/res/zharkova2019.pdf">Or my
copy of the article</a></p>

<p>And also:
<br>
<a href=

One of Zharkova's team website (reply to Suspicious
Observer)</a></p>

<p>These are Milankovich cycles.</p>

<p>Other cycles affect Earth, for example the effects of</p>

<p>The Oceans have got their own cycles, too, some being
multidecadal cycles. For example, one Pacific Ocean cycle is 60
years long, so a human that is lucky enough to live a long life may
live through Pacific Ocean cycle once, surely less than 2 full
cycles at the luckiest possibility for human life experience..</p>

<p>There are also Geologic forces which will change Earth face very
quickly even in terms of human life time span. Se this article from
Dr. Peet, a great geologist from last century in NYT article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>England is known to being eaten by the ocean (erosion) while
primitive regions have a habit of throwing up new islands and some
to vanish.</p>

<p>Some parts of Scandiavia have lifted from .45 to .95 meters per
century.</p>

<p>The Bavarian Alps have advanced closer to Munich at the rate of
a .30 to .91 meters in the course of 100 years.</p>

<p>In other parts of Germany church steeples which were formerly
not visible from certain points are beginning to rise above the
horizon..</p>

<p>--<a href=
"https://www.nytimes.com/1926/07/25/archives/europe-shrinks-as-earth-cools-geologist-finds-that-nordic-lands.html">Europe
Shrinks as Earth Cools</a>, <a href=
"https://github.com/mountaineerbr/extra/blob/master/NytRefs/europeShrinksAsEarthCools.pdf">
(or my copy of the article)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, humans have got a very limited experience and
power over their surroundings. Whereas rain storms may have a
regional impact on the environment (albeit for only a short period
of time), humans can only impact local environment such as for
example: the city will affect its own environment and its immediate
surroundings but as soon as you go farther to country side, city
effects soon disappear. I have seem many people trying to
extrapolate the very limited power of humans to affect the whole
Earth but that is only wishful thinking, as we shall see.</p>

<p>I fear science has become banal. Every one now thinks they are
`environmentalists' without the burden to dig deep into Ecology
(mostly important perhaps: Island Ecology). They are still very
naive about biology and ignore how brutal it has been and still is
against human beings.</p>

<p>As Schrodinger warns us:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the tribunal there sits by the side of the judges a
non-jurisprudent assessor- namely our own little self- which finds
it distasteful to pass for an automaton.</p>
--<a href=
"https://philosophyandphysics.wordpress.com/2014/11/22/do-electrons-think/">Schrodinger,
Do Electrons Think?</a></blockquote>

<p>And also <q>there is no boundary between the living and
non-living</q>, meaning we are bound by the same physical laws that
govern the entire universe.</p>

<p>Where do you guys live? I saw a comment in this thread of
somebody saying:</p>

<blockquote>We are at a point where most people have everything
they need</blockquote>

<p>I will not give you a reference but surely you guys should open
your eyes to the fact most people in the <em>World</em> have got
terrible life conditions and fight against illness, poverty and
hunger..</p>

<p>The biggest <strong>sustainability problem</strong> we have got
is <strong>Poverty</strong>. Get this one right.</p>
