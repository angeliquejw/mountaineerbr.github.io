<p>I am reading a lot of HTML code from other personal
blogs/websites.. I am seeing all those blogs I collected over the
years in a new perspective. Some of these blogs are from people
with information technology backgrounds, and yet they seem to use
<em>Jekyll</em> or some other layout programmes, such as
<em>WordPress</em> to generate pages. See <a hreflang="pt" href=
"https://aurelio.net/blog/">Aurelio Jargas' website</a>. Aurelio is
using <em>Jekyll</em> now, however it was possible to find a
<a hreflang="pt" href=
"http://web.archive.org/web/19970531231058/http://www.brasmidia.com/dumbs/">
very early webpage</a> of his Brazilian music group called
<cite>DUMBS</cite> written, presumably, by himself. The webpage
seems to have started with a simple, cool design (and one picture
of the band!), which was soon after buried under a lot of litter
(gifs, pictures), which would leave important information out of
sight. Sometime later, Aurelio writes in the website logs that the
page was slow to load, too! We can compare with the <a hreflang=
"pt" href="https://aurelio.net/dumbs/">music band final website</a>
he maintains as memoir of good times to this date.</p>

<p>There is no convincing me any of these programmes end up being
easier to learn and use than to make your own webpages with good
HTML and CSS code. The principle still ought to be a clean website
with good content is superior than busy and heavy websites.</p>

<p>It is clear that if a website grows, it starts to getting harder
to maintain the pages. However, CSS style sheets may prove very
handy for changing formatting of a series of posts. While HTML
structures the text, CSS will style it.
<br>
Not everything can be done with CSS but I reckon much can be done
without need of a complete rewrite of the website. Plus,
<em>sed</em> can be very useful in changing whole sections of HTML
documents. <em>Bash</em> may not be the most recommended language
for maintenance of a very large website, perhaps, however
<em>bash</em> is already <a type="text/plain" href=
"../res/script1.txt">helping me</a> with compiling the <a href=
"../cat.html">All posts</a> page. Every blog post has got its own
manually-crafted HTML page, with many logical tags which may serve
to present this same content in different ways for different
people, for example, for the visually impaired or the people in the
future, whenever in time.</p>

<p>Aurelio's writing style can be funny and that keeps the reader
interested. I shall try to keep this website light-spirited,
too..</p>

<p>For now, I cannot grow this website too much without further
defining and deciding on its basic structure. For that, I may even
make some drawings on paper and try to implement that structure in
HTML code..</p>
