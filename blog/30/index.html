<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->

<h2>Main topic - Bitcoin Full-relay Node</h2>

<p>During my <em>hodling</em>, I did various transfers from bitcoin
exchanges to private wallets, some of which are <em>legacy</em>
type.</p>

<p>That is not a bad idea to have some bitcoins (satoshis, that is)
in legacy wallets because some services, for example some bitcoin
exchanges, still do not work with <em>segwit</em> addresses..</p>

<p>However, as <em>on-chain</em> transactions are getting expensive
(Electrum suggests 8-30 sat/vB or more) to be added to a block
quickly, I imagine that will be a heavy fee for <em>hodlers</em> to
pay in the future, specially when the network is congested.. So I
decided to <em>sweep</em> legacy wallets to segwit wallets, as
advised by Andreas Antonopoulos.</p>

<p>In order to broadcast cheap transactions (1-4 sat/virtualByte)
to the bitcoin network, I needed to use my full node. I already had
all the block and txindex synchronised but I had only tentatively
set the defaults <code>8333 port</code> for outbound connections,
which characterises a <em>full-relay node</em>.</p>

<p>Not only that. To prevent one's IP from publicity in the bitcoin
network, there is the <strong>Tor</strong> hidden service which can
be activated. The Tor layer prevents most identification problems
associated with broadcasting one own transactions and and IP+ports
of a full-relay node with a technology named <em>security by
obscurity</em>.</p>

<p>Andreas Antonopoulos said those are not much of a problem
because one cannot be sure a transaction was originated from a
certain node or whether that node relayed them from another node or
from the onion network, although there are means someone can use to
identify users even under Tor (such as <a title=
"Bitcoin over Tor isn't a Good Idea" href=
"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305053676_Bitcoin_over_Tor_isn't_a_Good_Idea">
fingerprinting techniques</a>).</p>

<p>I sincerely reckon my little node is not worth the trouble from
these hackers.. I am setting up a slow-update <em>Manjaro
Linux</em> system which does not come with open ports by defaults
(sometimes, I run my node from an <em>Arch Linux</em> machine,
too). A <em>Linux system</em> is much more secure than running a
node in <em>Windows</em> which contain much exploitable code and is
probably infested with virus and other malicious software..</p>

<p><a title="Setting up a Tor hidden service" href=
"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Setting_up_a_Tor_hidden_service">Setting
a <em>Tor hidden service</em></a> is a little hurdle for someone
who never set up it before but after all that is not too hard with
<em>Bitcoin version 0.21</em>, specially.</p>

<p>I added the following to <code>/etc/tor/torrc</code>:
<code>ControlPort 9051</code>, <code>CookieAuthentication 1</code>,
<code>CookieAuthFileGroupReadable 1</code> and
<code>DataDirectoryGroupReadable 1</code>. Check <a href=
"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tor.md">this
help page.</a></p>

<p><em>Bitcoin version 0.21</em> <q><a title=
"0.21.0 Release Notes - Compatibility & P2P and network changes"
href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.21.0/">release adds
support for Tor version 3 hidden services</a>, and gossiping them
over the network to other peers using BIP155. Version 2 hidden
services are still fully supported by Bitcoin Core, but the Tor
network will start deprecating them in the coming months</q>.</p>

<p>That is important to note because even if you set everything up
correctly, <a title=
"Bitcoin Core 0.21.0 no incoming peers over Tor" href=
"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5309923.0">there may be
very few onion peers because they may not be using <em>Tor 3
services</em> yet</a>. Also, <a title=
"Bitcoin full nodes with IPv4 and IPv6 - Why most peers are on IPv4?"
href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347811">IPv6 peers
are much more rare than IPv4 peers</a>, which is the large majority
of peers.</p>

<p>I will leave some generic config which works for me
(<code>bitcoin.conf</code> and <code>/etc/tor/torrc</code>) at
<a href="../../repo/dotfiles/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf">my github
repo</a>. In these files, there are general commentary and
references for some config options, as well as setting up a
hardware client in the router..</p>

<p>A combination of settings may set the node to work dual-stack in
<em>clearnet</em> (IPv4 and IPv6) <strong>and</strong>
<em>onion</em> networks, which is a very important network
synchronisation role which few nodes partake..</p>

<p>The following steps are required:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install <code>bitcoind</code> (so-called <em>bitcoin core)</em>
and fully sync the blockchain, transaction index etc..</li>

<li>Configure router to redirect traffic from <code>port
8333</code> to your machine. This requires setting one's machine
MAC address in the router <em>client list</em> and then forwarding
of <code>port 8333</code> to the client.</li>

<li>Setting <em>bitcoin.conf</em> and <em>.torrc</em> configs.</li>

<li>Running <code>tor</code> daemon with the right configs</li>

<li><code>bitcoind</code> fully synched and properly
configured</li>

<li>Be sure your router has got active firewall or/and install a
operating system firewall such as <code><a href=
"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Uncomplicated_Firewall">ufw</a></code>.
In some cases, installing a firewall in Linux may not be required,
<em>DYOR</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Running a node does cost money: hardware, electricity and
internet bandwidth. However a full node can run on cheap computers,
such as <a href=
"https://blog.keys.casa/build-your-own-casa-node/">Casa nodes</a>
with Raspberry Pi 4, bandwidth may be problem.</p>

<p><code>bitcoind</code> option <code>maxconnections</code>
controls the maximum number of inbound+outbound connections. <em>10
slots</em> of are reserved for <em>inbound connections</em> and
<em>further connections</em> are <em>outbound slots</em> in a
<em>maximum of 125 connections</em> by defaults.</p>

<p>Nominally, my contracted speeds are <em>120 Mbit/s download</em>
and <em>10 Mbit/s upload</em>, However, my connection seems slow
and unstable these past few days.. I use to check connection speed
with <a href=
"https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli"><code>speedtest</code></a>.</p>

<p>Indeed, I just phoned up my internet provider and internet of
home area is under general maintenance. That may explain why I was
having horrible internet connection these days and that may not be
related to running <code>bitcoind</code>. It does seem my home
internet has got a slowdown, so I am checking that with the
provider..</p>

<p>However, a note is relevant. If one has got slow internet
connection, he may choose to set <code>maxconnections</code> and/or
<code>maxuploadtarget</code> to reasonable values.</p>

<p>Someone may check IP addresses of network peers
(<code>bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo</code>) against updated geolocation
tables to have an idea where other connecting peer nodes are.</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> internet connection problems arose at my
house in the last week or so and therefore the podcast episode was
uploaded earlier on YouTube than on my blog github repo.. I only
was able to upload the podcast episode #5 (~77MB) using a
university access point I have got access.</p>

<p><strong>PPS:</strong> the original recording of this episode
(m4a) got truncated (<q>Input buffer exhausted before END element
found</q>). Maybe I forgot to press the END button or the recorder
and just pressed PAUSE and closed the app.. I was able to check
that with <code>ffprobe</code> which comes bundled with
<code>ffmpeg</code>. So I recoded the stream to a new m4a audio
file, which should play correctly on all devices now.. Sorry if
your podcast has got the original copy instead of the recoded
file!</p>
