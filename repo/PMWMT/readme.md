    A poor man's way of doing things
    is still a way to get things done 


A poor man's website will often consist of a collection of static html files that get uploaded to a webserver under an el cheapo internet account, and lack any of the tools associated with real web hosting and content management systems.

The Silly Software Company fixes this problem by offering you the
[Poor Man's Webmaster Tools](https://web.archive.org/web/20200215004706/http://users.telenet.be/mydotcom/howto/www/tools.htm),
a collection of VB script and/or Bash shell scripts to automate common (and less common) web master tasks.
