Aurora Project for conky

-------------------------

Purpose 1 : Learn about conky, linux and my machines (Linux Mint and Ubuntu)

Purpose 2 : Automate the proces so that most of the scripts will on any computer

Purpose 3 : Teach about what i learn on http://erikdubois.be - article and 4 youtube movies

Purpose 4 :

Aurora theme is intended for a dual screen monitor. It has been designed on an a Samsung monitor 1680x1050 times two.
Right side gives an Conky overview of widgets and the left side is where you work. 
Left side has now also the netstat for port investigation as well as a test area where you can copy/paste code from the internet in.

Purpose 5 : Have fun. Explore the linux world.

Purpose 6 : Gather interesting conky's and incorporate them in one theme. To be activated at your will and learn how to do that in the process. Where possible the resource of conky will be added. I do not want to claim the work and creativity of third parties. I just want to learn.
