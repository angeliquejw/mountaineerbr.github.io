<!-- SUMMARY IN ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE -->

<div lang="pt" class="p-summary">
<p>Precisando fazer umas operações de varredura (<span lang=
"en">sweeps</span>) em umas carteiras e endereços antigos, achei
alguns detalhes sobre o processo de transmissão das transação para
os <span lang="en">mempools</span> através do meu nodo completo que
compartilho aqui.</p>
</div>

<br>
<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->

<p>There are some legacy bitcoin keys which produce vanity
addresses, such as <q>1Bio*</q> made with <code>vanitygen</code>
and some legacy wallets made with <code>Electrum</code> which
needed to be swept to segwit addresses as transaction fees are
doomed to get very high on the main chain as time goes on.</p>

<p>Some time ago, Adreas Antonopoulos said in one of his lectures
the best way to do that is to sweep the old wallets. Moving
<em>utxos</em> to a single address will reduce the size of the
following transactions but sweeping may generate a large
transaction (in bytes) because it can contain <em>various unspent
outputs</em>. That is why it is a good idea to do sweeps leisurely,
with time at hand and aiming for low fees..</p>

<p>I can sync my full node that lives in a USB hard drive with the
network. I have got the <code>bitcoind</code> inbound port open to
get other nodes to sync with me (including the <em>mempool</em>). I
just don't mine nor use <code>bitcoind</code> with my wallets
because I rather prefer <code>Electrum</code> to manage them.</p>

<p>I have been trying to set sweeps with small transaction fees,
such as 1-6 satoshi/Byte.</p>

<h2>Notes on broadcasting transactions from my full node</h2>

<p>As many of the readers may be aware, most <code>Electrum</code>
mempools will not accept transactions with very low fees and their
threshold is much higher than the minimum of 1sat/B as the default
relay (broadcasting) fee.</p>

<p>What the reader may not be aware of is about <em>the minimum
mempool fee</em>: <q>The amount of system memory allocated for
unconfirmed transactions is defined with the option
<code>maxmempool</code>. <code>maxmempool</code> defaults to 300MB
of RAM. Once the maxmempool-memory is fully used, the lowest-fee
transactions are dropped from the nodes mempool and
<code>mempoolminfee</code> is increased to reject lower-fee
transactions</q> (by <a href=
"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11955">0xB10C</a>).</p>

<p>Transactions may be dropped from the mempool just a few minutes
after they are added or until 336 hours (two weeks) or after even
longer.</p>

<p>Andreas Antonopoulos said he can get <em>most</em> of his
transactions through with 1sat/B fee, so I reckon he keeps
broadcasting his transactions through his own node until they are
taken in a block or he gives up.</p>

<p>Andreas said that even though transactions marked with the flag
<em>Replaceable By Fee</em> (RBF) are less dependable than
non-flagged transactions, all of his transactions are marked as
RBF. It should not really make much of a difference but if a
transaction is not marked as RBF, <code>bitcoind</code> will not
just double-spend the same <em>utxo</em> while the old transaction
is in your local mempool and will throw out a broadcasting error,
whereas RBF transactions are promptly double-spent and the older
transaction (conflicting transaction) is removed from the local
mempool by <code>bitcoind</code>.</p>

<p><a title=
"Bitcoin Fees: What are RBF and CPFP? What to do if my bitcoin transaction gets stuck?!?"
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL9Nu39qft4&t=331s">Andreas
also remarked</a> that <strong>RBF</strong> transactions may be
replaced by the <strong>sender</strong>, while <em>Child Pays For
Parent</em> (<strong>CPFP</strong>) transactions are made by the
<strong>recipient</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>I decided to use <code>Electrum</code> to make and sign the
sweep transactions and then broadcast them through my own node.</p>

<p>The first time I messed with those sweep transactions,
broadcasting a bunch of to my local mempool and soon
<em>blockcypher</em> could detect them in various other mempools,
too.</p>

<p>After less than 24 hours, no transaction could be found in other
mempools by <em>blockcypher</em>, but they still persisted at my
local mempool.</p>

<p>After restarting <code>bitcoind-daemon</code>, those old
transactions were rebroadcasted from my local node and could be
detected by <em>blockcypher</em> again. So if you don't want to
rebroadcast old transactions accidentally, be sure to remove
<code>mempool.dat</code> before <code>bitcoind</code> starts or
setting option <code>persistmempool=0</code>. File
<code>mempool.dat</code> is created by dumping mempool data from
RAM when <code>bitcoind</code> exits..</p>

<p>To keep rebroadcasting your own transactions, be sure to set a
large enough value for <code>maxmempool</code> size so your
transactions are not outside <code>mempoolminfee</code> range.</p>

<p>I will keep trying some more experimentations with low
transaction fees and broadcasting them from my own node to see how
many, if any at all, will be confirmed in the following few days..
So far, only one transaction with feed ~6sat/B got to the
blockchain, but that is higher than I want to pay for the other
transactions..</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> if you are using the clipboard and dealing
with <em>private keys</em>, beware not to paste one of them in a
block explorer as I did.. Ideally, don't connect your computer to
the internet while dealing with private keys. This avoids many
problems.</p>
