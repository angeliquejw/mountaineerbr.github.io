<!-- SUMMARY IN ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE -->

<div lang="pt" class="p-summary">
<p>Com a série <q>Biologia para Cínicos</q>, espero pode apresentar
uma visão mais seca e mais dura da realidade da disciplina de
ciências, porém mais próxima da relidade do que muitos livros e
instituições ensinam por aí.</p>

<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->

<p>There are many illusions about biology. I understand that is
<em>partly</em> so because commoners are too passionate about
Nature. In contrast, professional biologists ought to be cold and
rational about Nature, but not all of them are, either.</p>

<p>Today I saw an ad on TV about protecting wildlife, such as birds
and other animals of the forest. The ad said Nature does not need
us but we (humans) need Nature.</p>

<p>Well, I may disagree.</p>

<p>We are part of Nature, we are the <em>effect</em> of climate and
other conditions on Earth which allowed human beings to develop.
There is no reason at all to think animals (rational or not) in the
universe are alike earthbound ones.</p>

<p>Cities and buildings are also natural. I dislike the word
<q>natural</q> because it does not make much sense nor does it make
things clearer in a wider analysis. That word is just an umbrella
wording <a title="What's 'Natural' anyway?" href=
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucn2KzCDnOY">(and misused
nowadays)</a> but obviously I understand commoners will use that in
opposition to <em>man-made stuff</em>.</p>

<p>Why do commoners want to keep all species and avoid any and all
species going extinct? That is nonsensical! New species are
emerging all the time (why not?) as well as many others are going
extinct all the time.</p>

<p>Who can say an older species is better than a new species? And
what is <em>better</em> in this case, anyways? Newer species may
emerge because environmental conditions changed. Animals usually
have a very specific <em>niche</em> or a house in the environment.
If their house does not provide conditions, new species will evolve
to take that place! There is no vacuum in nature.</p>

<p>Not a few times I have seen reports of sightings of animals long
thought to have gone extinct! That kind of news is actually much
common if you start noticing them..</p>

<p>New species may eventually be more fit than older ones. Thus,
the value for the environment of new versus extinct species may not
change at different times (even if environment changes, too). Also,
species of a niche may change by random drift, meaning older and
newer species are equivalent and that is just by random chance one
goes extinct while the other occupies its place. Is that
<em>better</em> means <em>more fit</em>? If so, the better for the
environment means the more fit species. On the other hand, if
<em>better</em> means more useful, humans may be the best,
then.</p>

<p>Humans shall prove very useful for maintaining our natural
world. When we move from Earth, someday, we will take animals,
bacteria and viruses with us to new worlds. In the meantime, humans
will strive to keep species which are useful for them, such as
cattle, and will keep the ecosystem required by them and by
ourselves.</p>

<p>Human relation with the environment will improve over time as
humans get more comfortable and have got time to think about other
beings. Do not ignore humans fought natural forces all along to
avoid being crushed by them. Also, at our modern world, most world
population is very very poor and may not even have water or food to
keep their health.</p>

<p>Check the <a title="Curve Ambiental de Kuznets (EKC)" hreflang=
"en" href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w3914">environmental curve
of Kuznets</a>, which is, unfortunately, badly interpreted by
modern biologists because they do not seem to understand that what
is pollution for one species is food for others, a cycle.</p>

<p>Plants will actually use sulfur and nitrogen from car and
factory exhaust! Phosphorus from smoke can also be used by trees.
See for example <a title="Atmospheric Pollution and Plant Growth"
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/169376a0">(a)</a> or <a href=
"bleasdale1952.pdf">(local copy)</a>, <a title=
"Trees eat pollution products" href=
"https://www.nature.com/news/2008/080818/full/news.2008.1046.html">(b)</a>,

"As acid rain is curtailed, wheat gets less sulfur needed for tasty bread"
href=
"https://www.startribune.com/a-sourdough-tradeoff-as-acid-rain-is-curtailed-wheat-gets-less-sulfur-needed-for-tasty-bread/571971482/">
(c)</a>, <a title=
"African smoke is fertilizing Amazon rainforest and oceans" href=
"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190729151853.htm">(d)</a>
and <a title=
"Beijing's air pollution helps its trees grow better, faster, stronger, study finds"
href=
"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2155855/beijings-air-pollution-helps-its-trees-grow-better-faster">
(e)</a>. That is too bold a claim trees <em>clean the air</em>, as
some papers deem, but my point is just trees do use some sulfur,
nitrogen and other elements from air pollution for their own
benefit. Also note some researches are performed only under
laboratory conditions which exacerbate normal pollution levels by a
lot, which conclusions may be off from what happens in nature.
Carbon is food for photosynthetic organisms as they embody carbon
from the atmosphere into their body to grow. That is basic plant
physiology. That is actually quite fascinating if you can reckon
life is not under our control and life is too pungent and cannot be
detained on Earth.</p>

<p>Carbon is funny. More specifically, its bonds with other
chemical elements give it extreme flexibility at earthly
conditions. I hope to write a little article about how the carbon
atom originated life someday but I am still appreciating just how
funny an element that is.. Carbon is like Lego&reg; pieces and if
you can roll them enough with other elements, they will interact
and nucleate into ever more complex pieces and eventually life
forms.</p>

<p>If people love life and all species, then they must love the
bacteria and viruses, too. <em>Why not</em>? I suspect commoners
love <strong>some</strong> furry animals and their love gets weaker
the more genetically apart species are from humans. I cannot blame
them!</p>

<p>That is plain there are thousands of other planets supporting
life throughout Milk Way. There is no reason to think life on Earth
is better or worse than any other life in the universe. In my head,
generically, they all have got about the same value. So why humans
are so worried about protecting all species on Earth <strong>but
ourselves</strong>? It does not matter at all in the greater scheme
of things..</p>

<p>Microorganisms are much more important than animals. The energy
flux of the living start with photosynthetic and chemosynthetic
life. The frog, the bird, the lion.. They are <strong>not</strong>
more important than photosynthetic life so why do commoners want to
protect organisms that matter <em>the least</em> to Earth
environment? The frog, the bird, the lion and humans may get
extinct and it will not matter much or for long to our ecosystems.
New species will promptly take their place as long as the basal
energy availability is intact. Over time, even complex body schemes
may evolve from single cell organisms but more complex or rational
life may not necessarily develop.</p>
