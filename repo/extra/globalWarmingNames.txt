 This is a list of scientists who have made statements that conflict with the
 scientific consensus on global warming as summarized by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change and endorsed by other scientific bodies. A minority are
                                climatologists.
                                 [87bbabd2c8]
                                        
  Nearly all publishing climate scientists (97–98%^[1]) are convinced by the
evidence that humans are significantly contributing to global warming.^[1]^[2]
Nearly all publishing climate scientists (97–98%^[1]) support the consensus on
  anthropogenic climate change.^[3]^[4] The scientific consensus is that the
global average surface temperature has risen over the past century. Scientific
opinion on climate change was summarized in the 2001 Third Assessment Report of
 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The main conclusions on
                 global warming at that time were as follows:

   1. The global average surface temperature has risen 0.6 ± 0.2 °C since the
      late 19th century, and 0.17 °C per decade in the years 1971–2001.^[dead
                                     link]^[5]
 2. "There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over
       the last 50 years is attributable to human activities", in particular
    emissions of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane.^[dead link]^
                                        [6]
  3. If greenhouse gas emissions continue the warming will also continue, with
      temperatures projected to increase by 1.4 °C to 5.8 °C between 1990 and
    2100.^[A] Accompanying this temperature increase will be increases in some
     types of extreme weather and a projected sea level rise.^[dead link]^[7]
     The balance of impacts of global warming become significantly negative at
                     larger values of warming.^[dead link]^[8]

  These findings are recognized by the national science academies of all the
major industrialized nations;^[9] the consensus has strengthened over time^[10]
  and is now virtually unanimous.^[11] The level of consensus correlates with
                      expertise in climate science.^[12]
  There have been several efforts to compile lists of dissenting scientists,
including a 2008 US senate minority report,^[13] the Oregon Petition,^[14] and
   a 2007 list by the Heartland Institute,^[15] all three of which have been
               criticized on a number of grounds.^[16]^[17]^[18]
For the purpose of this list, a "scientist" is defined as an individual who has
  published at least one peer-reviewed research article in the broad field of
natural sciences, although not necessarily in a field relevant to climatology.
  Since the publication of the IPCC Third Assessment Report, each has made a
clear statement in his or her own words (as opposed to the name being found on
   a petition, etc.) disagreeing with one or more of the report's three main
   conclusions, and each has been described in reliable sources as a climate
  skeptic, denier, or in disagreement with any of the three main conclusions.
  Their views on climate change are usually described in more detail in their
 biographical articles. Few of the statements in the references for this list
   are part of the peer-reviewed scientific literature; most are from other
 sources such as interviews, opinion pieces, online essays and presentations.
    Nota bene: Only individuals who have their own Wikipedia article may be
                             included in the list.

        Scientists questioning the accuracy of IPCC climate projections

 These scientists have said that it is not possible to project global climate
accurately enough to justify the ranges projected for temperature and sea-level
rise over the 21st century. They may not conclude specifically that the current
 IPCC projections are either too high or too low, but that the projections are
likely to be inaccurate due to inadequacies of current global climate modeling.

    Graph showing the ability with which a global climate model is able to
 reconstruct the historical temperature record, and the degree to which those
 temperature changes can be decomposed into various forcing factors. It shows
    the effects of five forcing factors: greenhouse gases, man-made sulfate
   emissions, solar variability, ozone changes, and volcanic emissions.^[83]
   These scientists have said that the observed warming is more likely to be
attributable to natural causes, rather than to human activities. Their views on
   climate change are usually described in more detail in their biographical
                                   articles.

 1. ^ In its 2007 assessment report, IPCC projected likely temperature rise for
     various hypothetical levels of future greenhouse gas emissions, known as
       "emissions scenarios". They reported that during the 21st century the
     global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 1.1 to 2.9 °C (2.0
    to 5.2 °F) for the lowest emissions scenario used in the report, and 2.4 to
                  6.4 °C (4.3 to 11.5 °F) for the highest.^[200]
   2. ^ The compilation criteria for including scientists in the list is that
    they are relevant enough to have their own Wikipedia article, according to
                        Wikipedia's notability guidelines.
