<dt><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p08tmn3g">BBC&#39;s podcast &#39;What Planet Are We On&#39; with David Attenborough</a></dt>
<dd>The interviewer tried to start the conversation with hope but I am not sure Sir Attenborough managed to to inspire her very much. Also noteworthy how other people on the beginning of the podcasts already forecast grievance only.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-54435638">Prince William and Sir David Attenborough join forces on &#39;Earthshot&#39; prize</a></dt>
<dd>Grants worth £50m until 2030, which is about R$360.7m total.
<blockquote>The best and most innovative ideas to help:
<ul>
<li>Protect and restore nature</li>
<li>Clean our air</li>
<li>Revive our oceans</li>
<li>Build a waste-free world</li>
<li>•Fix our climate</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-54268038">Attenborough: &#39;Curb excess capitalism&#39; to save nature</a></dt>
<dd>Sir Attenborough says he is not an economist, which is fine <abbr title="In My Humble Opinion">IMHO</abbr>, however nothing stands in the way of his learning some of that. When he says we need to curb capitalism, what does that really mean? That does not mean anything. Beware of vague expressions.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6900011/Netflix-Walruses-fell-deaths-chased-polar-bears-NOT-climate-change.html">Netflix is accused of &#39;eco-tragedy porn&#39; in Attenborough documentary (2019)</a></dt>
<dd>Usage of drones instead of narrow-angle lenses to film walruses made them afraid and led them to falling off a cliff. Note that the polar bear which was at the scene is only partly to blame for the tragedy. If no drones were around, probably walruses would not just fall off the cliff.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/10/1075012">UN World Food Programme wins 2020 Nobel Peace Prize, as hunger mounts</a></dt>
<dd>Hunger is really worrying. Perhaps total world production of food is enough for all human beings, however there is a big problem with distributions systems. There are not enough distribution. We need more roads to take food (and fuel and technology) to those who live in very difficult places to access and cheap fuel.</dd>

<dt><a title="Topic: MOSAiC news" href="https://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,2906.1200.html">Mosaic expedition logs from Polarstern</a></dt>
<dd>Comments on the almost year-long transpolar-turned-peripolar expedition of Mosaic on the German ice breaker Polarstern. A copy of the forum thread in <a title="Topic: MOSAiC news" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mountaineerbr/extra/master/mosaic_polarstern_forum.arctic-sea-ice.net.txt">plain formatted txt can be found here</a>. The Mosaic expedition tried to follow the steps of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nansen%27s_Fram_expedition">Nansen&#39;s Fram expedition</a> (1893–1896), which aimed to reaching the geographical North Pole.<br>
<a title="Scientists on Arctic mission make unplanned detour to pole" href="https://money.yahoo.com/scientists-arctic-mission-unplanned-detour-111041410.html">This article</a> says Mosaic Polarstern reached geographical North Pole, however the forum logs say closest approach to North Pole was 166.3 km, information from post on February 26th from <em>young ice</em>. After the originally planned floe was abandoned during the covid pandemics, in search for a new floe they crossed the North Pole on August 19th, but that was a detour and not in the original plans of the expedition.<br>
A lot of public money was spent in this expedition, however the scientific groups released little data and there was not a centralised data or information supplier other than the <a href="https://follow.mosaic-expedition.org/">kindergarten-like portal</a> (entering deprecation as soon as the expedition was over last month). Most available info is spread across blog and social media posts. Official scientific papers with data from Mosaic expedition are planned to be released by 2023! IMHO, data should have been streamed live from the ship and everyone should be able to get that and do their won research, why not?!</dd>

<dd>Brazilian legislation makes it hard for cabotage type of navigation. Cabotage navigation would allow transporting a lot more resources along the very extensive coast of Brazil. Railroad development has been stagnant for decades in Brazil. Cabotage is not the silver bullet for the transport problems but would greatly help and reduce road transport.</dd>

<dd>The Brazilian govt says Brazil is lagging 8 years behind in genomic research. Thus, now they want to sequence 100 thousand Brazilian genomes (who must have some sort of rare disease) in the <strong>next four years</strong> with <a lang="pt" hreflang="pt" href="https://www.oantagonista.com/brasil/governo-pretende-investir-r-600-mi-para-criar-banco-nacional-de-genomas/">spending of R$600mi</a> (US$~107mi) and be the leading country in that field of research. Does that make sense? Some ethical and financial problems arise. For example, the project first aim is to generate a said &#39;reference&#39; genome of the Brazilian people. Perhaps they could generate a reference genome for peoples from Iceland, Norway and Japan, but hardly Brazil due to its great population miscegenation. There are lots of gene sequences or genome assemblies from people with rare diseases available <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genomes/?txid=9605&term=Homo&utm_source=nuccore&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=:assemb">in publicly accessible data banks</a> and I reckon a research group could obtain more whole genomes from specific public-restricted banks. If Brazil groups cannot advance in genomics with data already available, they will hardly advance with 100 thousand more genomes because data is not automatic information!</dd>

<dl>
<dt><a href="https://archive.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux update notes on sync&#39;ing with Arch Linux Archive (ALA)</a></dt>
<dd>I sync Arch Linux with the monthly repo (snapshot of the 1<sup>st</sup> of a month) from <abbr title="Arch Linux Archive">ALA</abbr>. However, sometimes even the monthly repo snapshot (which is used to generate the official Arch Linux install iso image) is not 100% stable for my specific hardware and thus I need to try and sync again some days later.. For example, what I do when there is news such as <q>nvidia 455.28 is incompatible with linux = 5.9</q> recently? I do not agree a rolling release distribution requires the user to update constantly as a rule.</dd>
<dt>Working with bitcoin private keys</dt>
<dd>How to set up a computer with a safe digital environment and how to try and leave no records.
<ul>
<li>use a dedicated computer with a free operating system, such as Linux distributions or BSD clones; <strong>there is no need to keep it up-to-date</strong>, one may use a snapshot of os and download a full copy of the official repos (usually below 50GB), for eg. <code>wget -r -np -e robots=off &quot;http://manjaro.c3sl.ufpr.br/stable/&quot;</code></li>
<li>avoid connecting to the internet while working with privy keys</li>

List cypher algos with <code>gpg --version</code>. <em>Do</em> make a backup of original files as some <code>gpg</code> versions may overwrite them!</li>
<li>remove automatic unencrypted backups made by text editors</li>
<li>avoid automatic backups by text editors (also swap and undoes), for example, add a modeline to files opened by vi(m): <code># vim:nobackup noundofile</code> (maybe leave <code>noswapfile</code> out)</li>
<li>overwrite and remove temporary or old files with <code>shred -n1 -uv [FILE..]</code></li>
<li>make backups of your encrypted files</li>
<li>tip from <a title="Domingão do Dovão - Outubro de 2020" hreflang="pt" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0qD8fxg85o">bitconheiros</a>, user may use Tails operating system, but personally I reckon that is not necessary if you pay attention to my tips above</li>

<dt><a hreflang="pt" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0tRKpaInZg">Vacinação compulsória (Fhoer)</a></dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt><a hreflang="pt" href="https://www.oantagonista.com/brasil/quem-decide-nao-tomar-vacinas-nao-deveria-poder-frequentar-espacos-publicos/">&quot;Quem decide não tomar vacinas não deveria poder frequentar espaços públicos&quot;</a></dt>
<dd>Compulsory vaccination: is reinforcement of a covid vaccine feasible? While OMS says SARS-CoV2 vaccine will be widely available only in 2022, is that fair that whoever is not able to get vaccinated until then should stay at home, isolated? There are many bad points about compulsory vaccination:
<ul>
<li>SARS-CoV2 vaccines are still under testing, nobody know if they are effective</li>
<li>As for all vaccines however small there is a chance of collateral effects; that is a risk a person must decide to take or not</li>
<li>Universality passes through the self first; in Japan, use of masks is to protect one self, the extended benefit of protecting others is only secondary and not as powerful as self protection</li>
<li>The person may not even get into contact with the virus in her lifetime</li>
<li>If a person is not able to get a vaccine, should he be discriminated?</li>
</ul>
I reckon that when a person is diagnosed with covid or any other contagious disease, he should stay at home but we cannot make people stay at home or discriminate them when they are not infected. The fears they are trying to mitigate with mandatory vaccination cannot be universal rule itself: imagine now that we must get a shot of vaccine for every possible disease because we must protect &quot;others&quot;?</dd>

<h2>Update on 03-nov-2020</h2>
<p>If youtube analytics is saying the truth to me, most listeners of the podcast drop before the 40min mark. That does not mean I should dumb down the content or shorten it for the sake of what most users do. However that was already a plan to make 40min podcasts so that is the goal next time. Maybe I will aim at 35min so I am sure to never run out of content!</p>
<p>I plan on recording another podcast episode only just before New Year&#39;s day or Christmas. Let&#39;s see.</p>
