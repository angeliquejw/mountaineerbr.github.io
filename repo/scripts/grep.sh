#1.merge test functions that can be merged with (un)setting glob/anchor
#variables intead of hard coding all test modes (zsh requires GLOBSUBST);
#2.fix? painting matched results: $ grep.sh 'b?sh' .bashrc
#will change resulting output from bash to b?sh;
#3.try to use bash ${BASH_REMATCH[@]} and zsh $match[@] after test with regular; zsh = setopt BASH_REMATCH
#expressions for painting results, check: https://thoughtbot.com/blog/the-unix-shells-humble-if;

	$SN - grep with shell built-ins


SYNOPSIS
	$SN [OPTION...] PATTERN [FILE...]
	$SN [OPTION...] -e PATTERN ... [FILE...]


	Reads from FILES or stdin.
	By defaults, performs pattern matching with \`globs'.
	Set option -E to use regular expressions instead.

	Set multiple PATTERNS with -e.


WILD-CARD VS GLOB VS REGEX



   GLOBBING PATTERNS
       The pattern arguments may contain any of the following special characters, which are a superset of those supported by  string
       match:

       ?         Matches any single character.

       *         Matches any sequence of zero or more characters.

       [chars]   Matches  any  single  character in chars. If chars contains a sequence of the form a-b then any character between a
                 and b (inclusive) will match.

       \x        Matches the character x.

       {a,b,...} Matches any of the sub-patterns a, b, etc.



REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
       A  regular  expression  is  a  pattern  that  describes a set of strings.  Regular expressions are constructed analogously to
       arithmetic expressions, by using various operators to combine smaller expressions.

       grep understands three different versions of regular expression syntax: “basic” (BRE), “extended” (ERE)  and  “perl”  (PCRE).
       In GNU grep there is no difference in available functionality between basic and extended syntaxes.  In other implementations,
       basic regular expressions are less powerful.  The following description applies to extended regular expressions;  differences
       for  basic regular expressions are summarized afterwards.  Perl-compatible regular expressions give additional functionality,
       and are documented in pcresyntax(3) and pcrepattern(3), but work only if PCRE is available in the system.

       The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that match a single character.  Most  characters,  including  all
       letters  and digits, are regular expressions that match themselves.  Any meta-character with special meaning may be quoted by
       preceding it with a backslash.

       The period . matches any single character.  It is unspecified whether it matches an encoding error.

   Character Classes and Bracket Expressions
       A bracket expression is a list of characters enclosed by [ and ].  It matches any single character  in  that  list.   If  the
       first  character  of  the  list  is  the  caret ^ then it matches any character not in the list; it is unspecified whether it
       matches an encoding error.  For example, the regular expression [0123456789] matches any single digit.

       Within a bracket expression, a range expression consists of two characters separated by a  hyphen.   It  matches  any  single
       character  that  sorts  between  the two characters, inclusive, using the locale's collating sequence and character set.  For
       example, in the default C locale, [a-d] is equivalent to [abcd].  Many locales sort characters in dictionary  order,  and  in
       these  locales  [a-d] is typically not equivalent to [abcd]; it might be equivalent to [aBbCcDd], for example.  To obtain the
       traditional interpretation of bracket expressions, you can use the C locale by setting the LC_ALL environment variable to the
       value C.

       Finally,  certain  named  classes  of characters are predefined within bracket expressions, as follows.  Their names are self
       explanatory, and they are [:alnum:], [:alpha:], [:blank:], [:cntrl:], [:digit:], [:graph:], [:lower:], [:print:],  [:punct:],
       [:space:],  [:upper:],  and  [:xdigit:].   For  example,  [[:alnum:]] means the character class of numbers and letters in the
       current locale.  In the C locale and ASCII character set encoding, this is the same as [0-9A-Za-z].  (Note that the  brackets
       in  these class names are part of the symbolic names, and must be included in addition to the brackets delimiting the bracket
       expression.)  Most meta-characters lose their special meaning inside bracket expressions.  To include a literal  ]  place  it
       first  in the list.  Similarly, to include a literal ^ place it anywhere but first.  Finally, to include a literal - place it
       last.

   Anchoring
       The caret ^ and the dollar sign $ are meta-characters that respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of  a
       line.

   The Backslash Character and Special Expressions
       The  symbols  \<  and  \>  respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a word.  The symbol \b matches the
       empty string at the edge of a word, and \B matches the empty string provided it's not at the edge of a word.  The  symbol  \w
       is a synonym for [_[:alnum:]] and \W is a synonym for [^_[:alnum:]].

   Repetition
       A regular expression may be followed by one of several repetition operators:
       ?      The preceding item is optional and matched at most once.
       *      The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.
       +      The preceding item will be matched one or more times.
       {n}    The preceding item is matched exactly n times.
       {n,}   The preceding item is matched n or more times.
       {,m}   The preceding item is matched at most m times.  This is a GNU extension.
       {n,m}  The preceding item is matched at least n times, but not more than m times.

   Concatenation
       Two  regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting regular expression matches any string formed by concatenating two
       substrings that respectively match the concatenated expressions.

   Alternation
       Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator |; the resulting regular expression matches any  string  matching
       either alternate expression.

   Precedence
       Repetition  takes  precedence over concatenation, which in turn takes precedence over alternation.  A whole expression may be
       enclosed in parentheses to override these precedence rules and form a subexpression.

   Back-references and Subexpressions
       The back-reference \n, where n is a single  digit,  matches  the  substring  previously  matched  by  the  nth  parenthesized
       subexpression of the regular expression.

   Basic vs Extended Regular Expressions
       In basic regular expressions the meta-characters ?, +, {, |, (, and ) lose their special meaning; instead use the backslashed
       versions \?, \+, \{, \|, \(, and \).




[[:alpha:]] [[:alnum:]]


in [[ = ]] [!x] and [^x] are the same
not so in [[ =~ ]]

BUGS
	Painting of matches may change output when using globs in
	searching pattern. Additionally, although patterns may be
	matched, they may not be painted in stdout.

	Slower than GNU grep. Zsh performance is slower than bash.


OPTIONS
	Pattern Syntax
	-E, -r     Interpret PATTERNS as extended regular expressions.
	-F 	   Interpret PATTERNS as fixed strings.

	Matching Control
	-e PATTERN Use PATTERN as the target string. If this option is
		   used multiple times, search for all patterns given. 
	-i, -y 	   Case insensitive match.
	-ii 	   Same as -i but prints matched line in uppercase.
	-v         Invert sense of matching, prints non-matching lines.
	-x 	   Whole-line matching, select only matches that exactly
		   match the whole line; this is like surrounding the
		   pattern with ^ and $ in a regex.
	-w


	Miscellaneous
	-h         Print this help page.
	-V         Print script version.
	-h, -H  conflicts with
	

	General Output Control
	-c 	   Suppress normal output; instead print only a count
		   of matching lines for each input file. With the -v
		   option, count non-matching lines.

	-k 	   Disable colour output.
	-m NUM 	   Maximum NUM results to print.
	-o
	-q         Quiet, exit with zero on first match found.


	Output Line Prefix Control
	-n 	   Prefix each line of output with the line number
		   within its input file.
	-Z
