<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->
<p>
I have been thinking since I quit my experience job at that marvellous
private company and finally came to tentatively putting the issue to rest.</p>

<p>After talking to an older dear friend who is currently at the 3<sup>rd</sup> year
of <em>agronomic engineering</em> and manages some of his family countryside properties,
he told me I probably got dehydrated and felt bad because of that!</p>

<p>Had I understood why I felt so bad during harvest,
I could have arranged for better preparation for the following day.</p>

<p>That is unfortunate I did not have the experience or a clear mind
nor someone who could had given me tips on the issue that night
while I was trying to think hard what had happened
and whether it was better to quit (which is what happened!)..</p>

<h2>What really happened to my body</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Anxiety</dt>
<dd>One of the older technicians asked me whether I were anxious
at lunch time.
I reckon anxiety was mainly for: new experience, smoking even less,
all other workers were, for one reason or another, different than me
and I could not relate more than strictly necessary.</dd>

<dt>Dehydration</dt>
<dd>At some point, I was sure there was not enough water for everybody
to drink <strong>freely</strong>, so I took the care to drink less often.
Some time after, my supervisor talking to another worker said
<q>drinking too much water dehydrates the body because one pees more</q>.
That is not true at all, however it is close enough to truth to be funny.
Water is a strong <strong>diuretic</strong> because one pees the more
one drinks it, however one will only (perhaps) get more dehydrated than
not in case of salt imbalance (too much salt being excreted)
because of water excess, but I am not sure overall that would be worse
than drinking too little water in the same period of time..
</dd>

<dt>Insolation/Heat Stroke</dt>
<dd>I did use less than adequate sun screen was not using shades
over my eyes, but I was heavily protected
by a sun protection hat, gloves, long-sleeved shirt, jeans, and boots..
Heat was intense.
I am sure I got a mild to moderate case of heat stroke at some point
because I was confused for the rest of the day and part of the following day..
</dd>

<dt>Noise/Vibration Distraught</dt>
<dd>I was not using the ear protection because I had forgotten it
back at the hotel
and I did not borrow it from someone on the field
because I did not think it would be too bad
for just one day. Guess I was wrong about that!</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Aggravating factors</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Still a smoker, although smoking less than before</li>
	<li>Sedentary lifestyle, 4 years smoking heavily at the computer
	will require more than a few weeks of irregular walking
	to improve</li>
</ul>


<h2>What should I have done?</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Take a large <strong>5-litre water bottle</strong> with me to that trip and
	to countryside fields so I could drink water freely</li>
	<li>Used the <strong>ear protection</strong> against noise</li>
	<li>Used the <strong>protection shades over normal glasses</strong>
	(which was at the hotel that day)</li>
	<li>Used <strong>more sun screen</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Worked slower</strong> and told my supervisor I could only work so fast</li>
	<li><strong>A couple of tips from a friend who lives in countryside</strong>
	and know it from old farm workers:
	<strong>freeze a PET bottle filled with water</strong> and
	carry that frozen PET the next day close to your body. You can
	also apply the PET with ice on your neck and face at rest times.
	At about midday, enough water must have melt and you can drink
	that cold water, then.
	<strong>Also,</strong> use a <strong>large straw hat</strong> and sun screen instead
	of that <span lang="pt"><em>Chapéu árabe</em></span>, which prevents
	air flow around the neck and head.
	Thanks, Bozelli!</li>
</ol>

<p>
I <strong>actually did</strong> reckon my sedentary lifestyle
and smoking habits would take their toll on my heart
if I worked too hard,
even though <strong>now</strong> I reckon I was just confused
and overtought it all..
</p>

<p>One point which I am proud of is that I did
not drink beer or any kind of alcohol during the work trip,
whereas other workers all drank at night during the 3 days
we spent together..</p>
