<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->
<p>I am not sure how to script out this podcast, but I sure want to record
one more episode.

</p>
<p>Actually, I did try recording a last episode for this podcast season,
but I decided to try to broadcast a live event on YouTube
with Streamlabs (Android) and lost the stream (about 36min) because
Streamlabs was not able to stream to YouTube. Didn't warn it in a way I could
understand before ending the event.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Sync news about YouTube channel (removed) and
	this website future developments (or lack of)</dt>
	<dd>Just go over the subjects on blog posts
	<a href="../38/">#38</a> and <a href="../39/">#39</a>.</dd>

	<dt>Plans for a future Season 1 of my podcast.</dt>
	<dd>The second season (Season 1) of the podcast may
	be in English. If so, episodes will be shorter and
	I will need planning a little more for each episode
	as I fear my spoken English may be rather rusty..</dd>
	
	<dt>Getting my parents vaccinated and Covid</dt>
	<dd>Dad vaccination went OK but mum was not able to have
	ser second shot, yet. We met some funny people while waiting
	on queues..</dd>

	<dt>Politics, public contests and jobs</dt>
	<dd>Cannot really say there is a <em>complete</em> lack of jobs
	but that is not a simple subject.. Some political notes.</dd>
	
	<dt>Bitcoin price, Elon Musk and Hodling</dt>
	<dd>Just to make sure I think Elon Musk is not making such
	good decisions anymore..</dd>
	
	<dt>Climate Summit</dt>
	<dd>USA is back, promises to cut emissions by 50% until 2050.
	Leader, some other countries try to follow suit.
	Bill Gates is an arse.
	<br>
	I wish these powerful people, not intelligent people,
	would talk about vanquishing hunger, illness and poverty.
	As it is, that summit is ridiculous.

	<dt>Mushroom and Psychedelics</dt>
	<dd>Talk about mushroom trip stories from some years back and <em>maybe</em>
	we should aim to have another mushroom trip <em>some time</em>.
	But before that, we need the appropriate <em>date, set and setting</em>.
