<p>Falando um pouco da descoberta das ferramentes em shell do site
<a href="http://users.telenet.be/mydotcom/howto/www/tools.htm">Poor
Man's Web Master Tools</a> e como isso me aliviou e me motivou a
tentar escrever uns scripts para gerenciar a área do blog..</p>

<p><em>IMPORTANTE: parece que o site do PMWMT está fora do ar??
Espero que não tenha parado de vez (<span lang="en">dead
link</span>?).. Se o link não voltar, ainda bem que há <a hreflang=

<p>Searching for personal website tips or something, I found some
really interesting stuff. For example, <a href=
"https://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-cms/how-they-hack-your-website-overview-of-common-techniques-002339.php">
this website</a> talks about website cracking and hackery in
general, which I found very amusing..</p>

<p>Anyways, it seems that indeed a webmaster needs to deal with
some data base and layout management. He could avoid them by using
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or <a href=
"https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>, or if he knows some
programming, he can try and manage his website all by himself.
Reading <cite>Jekyll</cite> documentation, it seems to deal with
three types of web pages:</p>

<ul>
<li>normal pages, usually not correlated to each other;</li>

<li>blog posts and a blog home page;</li>

<li>somewhat related pages, which they call
<i>collections</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I reckon that for unrelated and individual pages, it is a plus
if we can craft them manually. There are so many structural HTML
tags which can be used that I doubt <cite>Jekyll</cite> can apply
half of them from a <i>marked down</i> text.. That seems
incompatible: either use a mark up or a mark down language.
<br>
Such intricate structures can one make with <i>HTML</i> tagging,
although much is condemned to null or discreet rendering by web
browsers at this present time..</p>

<p>About the second bullet point, the blog portal and individual
post management can be a hassle. It is easy if you just write in a
single page, which gets ever longer. However, if you want to point
to individual posts only, then you should also have got individual
pages for them.
<br>
<cite>Jekyll</cite> (and other static webpage generators) uses a
lot of databases, and that is not the easiest to familiarise with
its defaults structures, although I am sure you can customise
almost everything..</p>

<p>At this point, I was almost overwhelmed and giving up on trying
to create my own tools for the job of managing a post database..
Most surprisingly, I found the <a href=
"http://users.telenet.be/mydotcom/howto/www/tools.htm">Poor Man's
Web Master Tools</a> (PMWMT) and <q>some silly scripts for
maintaining a static website</q>. Do note the referred scripts are
<strong>shell scripts</strong>. I was most delighted! IMPORTANT: It
seems the website for PMWMT is down, hopefully that is temporary..
If the link does not come online again, we still have got
<a hreflang="en" href=
"https://web.archive.org/web/2015*/http://users.telenet.be/mydotcom/howto/www/tools.htm">
a copy from Wayback machine</a>.</p>

<p>Much refreshed and elated, I got to work on my previous shell
script, which dealt only badly with concatenating all blog post
into <a href="../cat.html">a single page</a>.
<br>
Some <em>template</em> files were created. One holds most of
<em>HEAD</em> and <em>HEADER</em> contents while the other most of
the <em>BODY</em> and <em>FOOTER</em> contents.
<br>
Now, article text is written in HTML but are written in individual
files and only contains some metatags in a <em>HEAD</em> section
and a <em>ARTICLE</em> section, which are then merged with the
templates to generate a complete individual page for the post.
<br>
Finally, a function that merges all article sections of individual
posts into a long page with all posts. There is a hard corner which
is to fix all locally relative resource dirpaths in src tags, for
example for images or gifs. Here, I had to think long and hard and
created another directory at the root of the blog directory called
res/ for resources, as it cannot be called gfx for graphics because
I will be linking txt plain text, as well. When all resources moved
there, I was able to use <i>sed</i> to remove '../' references in
these fields..</p>

<p>The third bullet of the list above seems irrelevant as a worry
now. Either we can specially craft individual webpages or use the
same blog system for an eventual <em>collection</em> of related
pages..</p>

<p>There are still some improvements or features to implement for
my own use, that is a way to automatically update the website
portal blog post section and the blog portal with latest post
titles.. That should not be too hard to do with some <strong>shell
scripting</strong> and <strong>sed</strong>..
<br>
You can check a script snapshot <a href="../res/script4.html">in
this link</a>. I will be improving that over time, but I provide it
here just so as a reference of what can be done for the reader.</p>

<p>Although I am not currently using <cite>PMWMT</cite>'s code (I
am writing my own), reading those scripts are a blow of fresh air..
When I next write a script for generating a sitemap.xml file, I may
use some of <cite>PMWMT</cite> code, though..</p>

<p>There may be a vague resemblance of functionality with <a href=
"https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb">Luke Smith's lb and sup</a>, a
<q>blog script and site updater</q> he wrote for his own blog.
However, he does not seem to care about adding metatags to blog
posts, such as keywords.. Other blogs could use their post
categories as keyword metatags..</p>

<p>Just for the record, there are two more scripts o deal with
website or blogging. The first one is <a href=
"https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html">Roman Zolotarev's
ss5</a>, which is <q>a static site generator written in shell</q>.
There is also <a href=
"https://github.com/slackjeff/hacktuite">Slackjeff's hacktuite</a>,
a shell script that makes a static microblog.</p>

<p>PS: package <code>tree</code> can also make a directory (and
file) listing in HTML with option <code>-H</code>. One can use flag
<code>-P</code> to search for filetypes and flag <code>-I</code> to
ignore some files. It must be run at the root directory of the
website. Example:</p>

<pre><code>$ tree -H "https://mountaineerbr.github.io" \
        -P '*.htm|*.html|*.php|*.asp|*.aspx|*.jsp' \
        -L 6 -F -o "tree.html" -v --noreport --charset utf-8 \
        -I '[a-z].html|index.html|fool.html|bak|css|gfx|js|res|misc|google*|PMWMT'</code></pre>
