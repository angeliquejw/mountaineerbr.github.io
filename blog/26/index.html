<!-- SUMMARY IN ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE -->

<div lang="pt" class="p-summary">
<p>Falando um pouco do meu novo emprego em uma empresa de
<strong>Organismos Geneticamente Modificados</strong>. Também,
penso sobre a oportunidade de experiência deste emprego mas
principalmente no meu futuro profissional..</p>

<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->

<p>Over one month ago, I distributed curriculum copies to some of
the largest companies nearby. Last week, I was contracted!</p>

<p>Today was the first day in my new job. There were long lectures
about what exactly we will be doing and work safety. The company
works with <strong>Genetically Modified Organisms</strong> (GMO).
That is a temporary contract and I will be harvesting soybeans from
experimentation crop fields, which is a little more laborious and
requires more care than common harvesting, as the soybeans will be
further tested and interbred.</p>

<p>We shall be using heavy machinery (harvesters) and, as it has
been raining rather a lot in the last week, manual harvesting as
well.</p>

<p>This is a great entry level job for agronomists students and
biologists involved with agriculture. A lot of heavy work. In fact,
the minimum and necessary education degree is high school.</p>

<p>I reckon I will be happy in the countryside for the duration of
the contract (3 months at most) and gaining experience, however I
am far from sure I want to keep working there in similar positions
for many years to come. Or worse yet, to becoming an
<em>executive</em>..</p>

<p>I was very anxious last weekend mulling over thoughts of working
in that company for the next 30 or 35 years until I get to retire,
so there is some comfort in that this job is but temporary.</p>

<p>Also, my dear friend, Bidia, told me that working an entire life
in a company is something of the past, nowadays most jobs last 4,
maximum of 5 years..</p>

<p>Even before receiving the job offer call last week, I had
started considering seriously about my career as a biologist. I
wrote en e-mail to an old technician fellow I met in 2008 when I
started graduation to ask for some tips. He is a doctor biologist
in limnology and was hired as a <em>de facto</em>
<em>biologist</em> in university. Frossard used to work in
pisciculture as a limnologist and after that university branch
ended, he works <q>more or less like a librarian who works with
fish instead of books</q> in a zoology museum.</p>

<p>I wrote a very long e-mail and he wrote a long answer, which I
read from start to end at least 3 times so far. He has got an
incredible life history and I identified with many parts of it,
such as enjoying university campus as though it were an amusement
park and the fun of laboratory life..</p>

<p>There is something he told me that may help to decide what
profession or job you want for your life: <em>think about what you
would have do in 10 years from now</em>..</p>

<p>Not an easy task but hard thinking will eventually prove
fruitful. I already have got one idea for starters: <em>a public
job</em>.</p>

<p>Thanks, dear Frossard!</p>

<p>Out of the dozen public contests I tried (most of which while I
was busy studying financial markets), there were some which deserve
mentioning:</p>

<ul>
<li><span lang="pt"><em>Itaipú</em></span> (a very big
hydroelectric energy supplier)</li>

<li><span lang="pt"><em>Instituto Águas e Terras</em></span>
(public state division which oversees land and water affairs)</li>

<li><em>biology council</em> (however bureaucratic, a very large
contest)</li>

<li>Temporary positions as teacher in higher education and
scientific institutes such as <em>IFSC</em> and <em>UTFPR</em></li>
</ul>

<p>There are some other public contests for which I am
interested:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>IBAMA</em> (public regulator of environment and biology
stuff),</li>

<li><em>Funai</em> (promotes indigenous people health and
property),</li>

<li>and national parks.</li>

<li>Universities and research institutes, maybe not as a teacher
but biology technician.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the exception of the biology council, which is 100% a
bureaucratic job, others mentioned above offer positions for people
to be more in the field. Working in a national park or university
seems specially appealing..</p>

<p>As my mum was a public employee and had some good bonuses before
going retired, a public position always seemed appealing for
me.</p>

<p>But that will be it for today.</p>
