Depois de ver dar uma olhada melhor no
<a hreflang="en" href="https://lukesmith.xyz/blog">blog do Luke Smith</a>,
estou pensando em copiar algumas seções,
como por exemplo, inaugurar um podcast em
<b>Português</b>. Definitivamente, o meu conteúdo vai ter que ser
espalhado em duas línguas. Veja, por exemplo, meu canal
<a hreflang="pt" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/XGnuBio">canal no YouTube</a>,
totalmente em português.. A ideia de um podcast é muito boa pois
abre uma avenida de possibilidades, além de ser mais fácil de gravar,
quem sabe um episódio por mês.. Aguardem..

<a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/blog">Luke Smith's blog</a>
has nice posts about his website development.
Specially, today, I was reading
the very first posts, from may 2008, and he states preference for
a minimalist website. There is also depth to his website, browsing it
I could find many links to different sections of his website: video,
podcast and rss feed. He has got even a forum, which I avoided entering
so far, may check it later. That <a href="https://larbs.xyz/">LARBS</a>
distribution seems
to have many users. I would't dare using it, because that would be
one more layer -- instead of having to learn how to configure
the tools themselves, I would have to learn how to configure his
<cite>LARBS</cite> tools.. And I just found how convoluted his
distro design might be, look at how redundant is this directory
structure, which he cites in <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/blog/font-gone-crazy-in-larbs">this post</a>
in which you navigate downwards levels until you can find the distro
default configuration file at
<code>~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code>.
</p>

<p>His website has very interesting ideas, pages and depth to content.
Specially, the podcast section got my attention. I already have got a
<a hreflang="pt" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/XGnuBio">YouTube channel</a>
(in portuguese),
and some faithful followers, even though I advertise that channel as
a B-side channel, meaning produced with
as little time as would afford that..
However, a podcast, in which only
the voice is the most important piece of the play, seems like good fun.
That is easier to record, easy to upload, easy to download..
It can have high quality sound as any mobile phone
has great microphone, much different from my computer microphone
used for producing my youtube channel content!
</p>

<p>It would make sense to have my podcast in portuguese, which means
effectively splitting content in two languages in this website.
Production would be slower, one episode a month. And I could have
co-hosts or interviews, chatting with other cool people, so
that is a big opened avenue.
