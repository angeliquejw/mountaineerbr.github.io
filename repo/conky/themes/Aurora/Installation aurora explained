You want to be able to run as quickly and easy as possible, I know but read this anyway diagonally.

Procedure for installation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 	INSTALLING CONKY AND ALL THE NEEDED COMPONENTS

	
	GENERAL INFORMATION


	Some of the commands I use to report details of my machine require a root elevation. 
	To circumvent this I use a command in the terminal. Best not done on business 
	computers, but for private owned computers...wtf

	The idea of this project is to automate the installation and in the proces
	 learn a lot about linux and my machine.

	To be able to read out sensors of your computer you need to install sensors.
    	You do not need to use the installation scripts. 
    	You can Copy/paste each command line in the terminal. It can be a
    	learning experience.

	NVIDIA Panel will only work on computers with a nvidia card. Duh!

	To be able to read out what harddisk you have, you need to install smartctl.

	To be able to read out what temperature you have, you need to install hddtemp.

	To be able to see the weather widget you need curl.



	INSTALLATION

	Normally the file is already an executable script but if not you have to make it executable. 
	Explained on Youtube and on erikdubois.be.

	You need to make the files "Auto_LinuxMint_Rosa_cinnamon_aurora.sh" or "Auto_Ubuntu_Utopic_aurora.sh" an executable so you can run it in a terminal.

	In linuxmint you can use right-click on the file AUTOINSTALL_AURORA.sh, got to properties and take
	tab permissions. Underneath make it an executable.

	Double click on the file AUTOINSTALL_AURORA.sh. Choose run in terminal to do the installation or choose Display 
	to read what will happen on your computer.

	If you know your way around the terminal(CTRL+T). Use the "sudo chmod u+x AUTOINSTALL_AURORA.sh".
	This will als make it an executable.

	READ WHAT COMES UP IN THE TERMINAL AND FOLLOW ANY INSTRUCTIONS

	
	TORRENT SPECIFIC - TRANSMISSION !!!!!!!!!!!!

	If you want your torrent popping up in the widget, you need to go to the program transmission.
		Open it.
		Go to edit.
		Choose preferences
		Choose tab remote
		Allow remote access
		Do not worry. Only you (127.0.0.1) can see this.

	(if someone finds a command to do the above let me know)

	If you want the GMAIL script to work, please fill in your username and password.
	Make sure that in your GMAIL you can make an IMAP connection.

	You should also check out the harddisks_explained_aurora file. You will probably need to change 
	the sda, sdb, sdc... if SATA'S or hda, hdb and hdc for the IDE harddisks. Search and replace...



2	DOWNLOADING THE AURORA THEME 

You have an assistant on youtube, watch http://erikdubois.be/category/linux/aurora-conky/

- You have executed the auto installation file (ubuntu or linux mint) 
- start first the conky manager - THIS WILL CREATE THE HIDDEN .CONKY FOLDER !!  and close it again
- Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/auroraconkytheme/
- download the latest theme
- unpack it (right-click)
- the folder gets a name like "Aurora_v3.x.x"


- change the name of the folder in "Aurora"  ###IMPORTANT###    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
		
		SCRIPTS POINT TO ~/.conky/Aurora  (first letter capital)
		it should normally be named like that automatically


- again whatever version you are downloading CHANGE THE FOLDER MANUALLY TO AURORA
- Go to your Home folder
- type CTRL+ H  (H for hidden folders)
- ".conky" is now visible    !!! ONLY VISIBLE IF YOU STARTED CONKY MANAGER
- copy/paste the folder Aurora in this hidden ".conky" folder
- start Conky Manager and activate the widgets you want or use a themes
- if you want to use the fonts in the fonts folder, install by double clicking (eg. Clock has Inspira font)-
- a script is normally in place that puts all your fonts in ./fonts. So installing fonts should not be necessary.
- change the nomination of your harddisk manually - read text harddisks - SDA OR HDA /home /etc...
- sensors-detect is a program that will look at your hardware do this if not already done
- in the terminal execute sensors and see what you get - change the grep search pattern to one's you have or use the widget
  sensors to see what you are missing in the conky file. Sometimes it is named temp1 or tmp1 or other. This is related to YOUR motherboard.

3 STARTING THE AUTOSCRIPT OR NOT

- Choose the autoscript you need for your system. There are minute differences because of the naming of some of the programs.

- run in a terminal to see what it will do.
		./Auto_LinuxMint_Rosa_cinnamon_aurora.sh
