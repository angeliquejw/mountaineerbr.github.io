<!-- MAIN TEXT  -->

<p>I don't think any clone of <code>ksh</code> can beat the
original in term of speed because Korn's C code cannot be beat.</p>

<p>Feature-wise, <code>mksh</code> wants to be compatible with
<code>bash</code> and <code>oksh</code> is a little more true to
<code>ksh</code> however it has gone a different path and has got
less features than <code>ksh</code>. But I haven't read nor used
near enough about these yet to have any due criticism..</p>

<p><code>ksh</code> code is also dependent on other software from
<a href="https://github.com/att/ast/">Advanced Software
Technology</a> suite, developed by Mr Korn and a few others through
many decades of work.</p>

<p>When Siteshwar and Kurtis Rader started to work on
<code>ksh</code> code in 2017 thereabouts, they <a title=
"Squeezing Water from Stone - KornShell in 2019" href=
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J20eGwGCwU">could not understand
it very well</a> and chose to remove large chunks of the code and
rewrite whatever was left in such a C idiomatics and using
compilers that made the shell terribly slow compared to original
stable <code>ksh93u+</code> and ultimately led to the AST code
reversion.</p>

<p>In retrospective, if Siteshwar and kdrader1961 wanted to change
so much of the code, they should have <strong>forked</strong>
<em><code>ksh</code> repo</em> in the first place</p>

<p>I am happy some stepped up and manage to get AST (and
<code>ksh93</code>) official repo back on the correct track.</p>

<p><code>ksh</code> seems like a suitable default shell for
scripting. Feature-wise, that is comparable to
<code>bash+zsh</code> in some sense. Even though Mr Korn, Mr Glenn
and others stopped developing AST tools, I reckon these tools can
be useful for quite some time yet almost unrivalled..</p>

<p>For example, instead of using GNU or <code>busybox</code>
default utilities such as <code>grep</code>, one can use AST
<code>grep</code>, <code>wc</code> and so on..</p>

<p>AST repo was easy to compile in my machine and
<code>ksh93</code> had many features enabled by defaults. I wonder
why Siteshwar decided to change the compiler if this works so well
in my current machine and, as I have read, in so many legacy
hardware architectures, too.</p>

<p>I will be using <code>ksh</code> for scripting more often. There
are some specific cases <code>ksh</code> beats <code>zsh</code> and
<code>bash</code> by a lot, in other cases just by little. Still,
it does not let the user expectations down as it seems to always be
faster than these other big shells.</p>

<p>In fact, I rewrote a <code>bash</code> <a href=
"../../repo/scripts/bitcoin.tx.sh">bitcoin parser script</a> in
<code>ksh</code>. Unfortunately, in this case, as the script is so
big, convoluted and makes heavy use of external tools (mainly
<code>bitcoin-cli</code> and <code>jq</code>), it cannot be get
much faster.. Still I got a 10-15% speed increase and sometimes
more than that depending on the functions used. However, if you are
going to use that script parser, prefer the <code>bash</code>
version as the <code>ksh</code> code is experimental and not fully
tested to match <code>bash</code> output..</p>

<p>Below are some references I spent almost a full day reading.
They are related to <code>ksh</code> more recent developments and
some other references from a live event I made recently on
YouTube..</p>
